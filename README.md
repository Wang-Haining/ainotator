# ü§ñ AInotator: Annotate Computer-Mediated Discourse with LLMs

Can LLMs understand what is meant, not just what is said?
**AInotator** puts this question to the test by automatically annotating computer-mediated discourse using state-of-the-art language models.

For each utterance in context, we assign:

- **Communicative Act Labels** (e.g., Accept, Request, Reject)
- **Politeness Tags** following Brown & Levinson (1987), Herring (1994) and Culpeper (2011)
- **Meta-Acts** (e.g., [non-bona fide], [reported])

Annotations are generated through structured prompting with **mandatory reasoning** and saved in a reproducible, debuggable format. The tool supports:

- **Multiple model backends**: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Meta Llama
- **Corpus-agnostic processing**: Works with any CMC dataset structure
- **Resumable runs** with comprehensive progress logging
- **Always-on reasoning**: Every annotation includes step-by-step analysis
- **Robust error handling** with automatic retry and reasoning validation
- **Reproducibility** through fixed seeds and complete audit trails
- **No file modification**: Original data files are never altered

## üí° Why It Matters

Manual annotation of online discourse is slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale. Traditional rule-based systems struggle with context, sarcasm, and pragmatic nuance.

AInotator offers a **practical, theory-aware solution** that:
- Captures communicative intent beyond surface form
- Handles non-literal language (sarcasm, irony, rhetorical questions)
- Maintains theoretical grounding in established CMC frameworks
- Scales to large datasets while preserving annotation quality
- Provides transparent reasoning for every decision

Perfect for CMC researchers studying **stance, identity, politeness, conflict, and solidarity** at scale.

> LLMs may be changing the game ‚Äî but we still define the rules.

## üß≠ Annotation Schema

The model follows the **CMC Act Taxonomy** (Herring, Das, and Penumarthy 2005; revised 2024) adapted from CMC pragmatics and politeness theory.

### üéôÔ∏è Communicative Act Labels (18 total)

| Label          | Definition | Example                                                              |

| **Inquire**    | Seek information; make neutral proposals | "What's up with people being upset about this?" |
| **Invite**     | Seek participation; suggest; offer | "You might want to post this in another subreddit." |
| **Manage**     | Organize, prompt, focus, open/close discussions | "I have two thoughts about that..." |
| **React**      | Show listenership, engagement | "Lmao this is so dramatic."; "wow" |
| **Reject**     | Disagree, dispute, challenge | "Dude! You came here for answers and you are NOT listening." |
| **Repair**     | Clarify or seek clarification; correct misunderstanding | "Did you mean 'school holiday'?" |
| **Request**    | Seek action politely | "Can someone explain this to me?" |
| **Thank**      | Express gratitude, appreciation | "Thanks for saying this." |

### ü™û Politeness & Impoliteness

Based on **Brown & Levinson (1987)** Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem, while negative politeness respects their autonomy.

| Code      | Meaning                                     | Examples                                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **+P**    | Affirm positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated) | Compliments, support, friendly humor |
| **+N**    | Respect negative face (desire for autonomy) | Hedging, deference, giving options |
| **-P**    | Attack positive face | Insults, mocking, condescension |
| **-N**    | Attack negative face | Commands, intrusive questions, impositions |

**Impoliteness subtypes** (Culpeper 2011): `[Insult]`, `[Condescension]`, `[Dismissal]`, `[Silencer]`, `[Threat]`, `[Negative association]`

### üè∑Ô∏è Meta-Acts

| Tag            | Description                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **[non-bona fide]** | Sarcasm, irony, jokes, rhetorical questions     |
| **[reported]**      | Quoting or paraphrasing others' speech/thoughts |
