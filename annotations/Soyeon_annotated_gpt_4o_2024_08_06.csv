1,1,250127,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,,0.0,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"" is the opening question from CallSign_Fjor in a Reddit post. It introduces the issue they are experiencing with friends who lose interest in gaming once they have progressed further than the friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is seeking an understanding of a specific behavior—friends losing interest in games because of another player's faster progression. This suggests that the primary intent is to seek information or an explanation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is phrased as a question, seeking insight or explanation from others about a specific behavior. This is the most straightforward interpretation.
   - **Claim**: It could be considered a claim if interpreted as the speaker expressing a belief about people's behavior, but the interrogative form and context suggest the speaker is more interested in understanding others' perspectives.
   - **Repair**: If the question were seeking clarification about an earlier misunderstanding, it could be a repair, but here, it is more about gathering new insights.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance does not exhibit any explicit markers of politeness or impoliteness. It's a neutral inquiry.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or reported speech in the utterance.

The most fitting act, given the form and context, is **Inquire**, as the speaker is asking a question to seek information or explanations from others.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

Despite not using advanced gear in multiplayer, friends were disinterested due to CallSign_Fjor's advanced progress.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The main intent of CallSign_Fjor's message is to narrate an experience. They provide a detailed account of the events that transpired when they played a single-player game, how they adjusted their play when returning to multiplayer, and the reaction of their friends. This is primarily providing factual information about what happened.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:

   - **Elaborate**: The user is not expanding upon a previous statement within the thread but rather presenting the main narrative. 

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the statement. It is neutral and focused on recounting events.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is an element of reported speech where the user describes their friends' reactions (""their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game""), but the main communicative act is still informing about the user's experience.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user CallSign_Fjor is sharing an experience where friends lost interest in playing Terraria because CallSign_Fjor progressed further in a single-player mode. Despite not using advanced gear in multiplayer, friends were disinterested due to CallSign_Fjor's advanced progress.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The main intent of CallSign_Fjor's message is to narrate an experience. They provide a detailed account of the events that transpired when they played a single-player game, how they adjusted their play when returning to multiplayer, and the reaction of their friends. This is primarily providing factual information about what happened.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inform**: The user is providing detailed information about the sequence of events and the reactions of their friends. This is verifiable in principle as it recounts specific actions and reactions.
   - **Claim**: While there is a subjective element in expressing confusion over friends' behavior, the primary content is factual.
   - **Elaborate**: The user is not expanding upon a previous statement within the thread but rather presenting the main narrative. 

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the statement. It is neutral and focused on recounting events.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is an element of reported speech where the user describes their friends' reactions (""their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game""), but the main communicative act is still informing about the user's experience.

The utterance's primary act is **Inform** as it provides a recount of events and reactions from others, with an embedded element of reporting on others' excuses.

At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,Original post,,0.0,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance describes a previous incident where CallSign_Fjor's actions in a game led another player to quit. The speaker recounts a situation where their progress in a game was perceived as invalidating by another player.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is sharing a past experience to support their point about players feeling invalidated by others' progress. The primary intent is to provide evidence of this recurring issue, rather than to express a personal opinion or feeling.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about a past event, making this the most straightforward option. The event described is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: While there is a subjective element in describing the other player's stance as feeling invalidated, the overall content is more factual.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could also be seen as elaborating on the initial post's topic, but it primarily serves to inform about a specific incident.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting a past event.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is straightforward and does not involve reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a bona fide statement about a past event.

The most appropriate communicative act label for this utterance is ""Inform"" as it provides factual information about a previous incident that supports the user's argument.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n|-----|-------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise an accomplishment; Express confidence in future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that. First, ... Second, ...\""; \""That's my final word on the matter.\"" |\n| **React** | Show simple listenership, engagement (positive, negative, or neutral) | \""That's great/terrible!\""; \""hahaha\""; \""lmao\""; \""wow\""; \""hmm\""; \""ugh\""; \""yeah\"" |\n| **Reject** | Disagree, dispute, challenge; insult | \""No way is that accurate.\""; \""Gayyyy\"" |\n| **Repair** | Clarify or seek clarification; correct misunderstanding | \""Did you mean 'school holiday'?\""; \""Just kidding.\"" |\n| **Request** | Seek action politely, make direct or indirect request | \""Can you plz send pics?\""; \""Would you mind sharing the link?\"" |\n| **Thank** | Appreciate, express gratitude | \""Thanks so much.\""; \""It's very nice of you to offer.\"" |\n\n## Meta-Acts\n\n| Tag | Description | Examples |\n|-----|-------------|----------|\n| **[reported]** | In the case of reported acts, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most relevant for act analysis, in which case the act code is assigned to it, rather than to the matrix (embedding) clause. | \""She said she wants to go.\"" → code DESIRE [reported] |\n| **[non-bona fide]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance describes a previous incident where CallSign_Fjor's actions in a game led another player to quit. The speaker recounts a situation where their progress in a game was perceived as invalidating by another player.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is sharing a past experience to support their point about players feeling invalidated by others' progress. The primary intent is to provide evidence of this recurring issue, rather than to express a personal opinion or feeling.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about a past event, making this the most straightforward option. The event described is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: While there is a subjective element in describing the other player's stance as feeling invalidated, the overall content is more factual.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could also be seen as elaborating on the initial post's topic, but it primarily serves to inform about a specific incident.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting a past event.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is straightforward and does not involve reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a bona fide statement about a past event.

The most appropriate communicative act label for this utterance is ""Inform"" as it provides factual information about a previous incident that supports the user's argument.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?",,Original post,,0.0,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is a part of a Reddit post where the user CallSign_Fjor is expressing confusion over why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria after finding out that CallSign_Fjor had progressed further in the game. CallSign_Fjor is questioning the mentality of their friends and others who feel invalidated by someone else's progression. 

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent here is to express confusion and seek understanding about a behavior they do not comprehend. They are trying to understand why having more people who can mine for rare resources or having progressed further would be seen negatively. 

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is framed as a question, seeking information or explanation about a specific behavior.
   - **Claim**: It could be interpreted as expressing a subjective viewpoint or confusion about the situation.
   - **Reject**: The underlying tone could be seen as challenging the behavior or reasoning of those who feel invalidated.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness. The tone is more of inquiry and seeking understanding rather than attacking or supporting someone.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or sarcasm. It appears to be bona fide communication seeking a genuine explanation.

Given the context, the primary communicative act seems to be **Inquire** as CallSign_Fjor is asking questions to understand a behavior they find puzzling.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user, CallSign_Fjor, discusses their confusion about why their friends lose interest in playing games with them once they have progressed further. They mention how, in the past, having advanced items or progress was seen as prestigious and motivated others.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary goal of this utterance is for CallSign_Fjor to express their lack of understanding or confusion regarding their friends' mentality. The speaker contrasts past and present gaming attitudes, highlighting their personal perspective and confusion.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their understanding and their perspective on gaming culture changes.  
   - **Inquire**: Although the speaker starts with ""I do not understand,"" which may seem like a request for information, the context shows they are not actually seeking information but rather expressing a perspective.  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is not primarily providing factual information but rather sharing a personal viewpoint, which aligns more with Claim.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is more of a neutral expression of confusion and perspective.  

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is sincere and straightforward.  

Given the speaker's focus on expressing their subjective viewpoint and confusion, the most fitting label is **Claim**.

6,1,250127,,AurelianoTampa,,Did you ask your friends? ,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,D2,55.0,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Did you ask your friends?"" is a response to the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, who is expressing frustration and confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria and other games with them after they had progressed further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to be suggesting that CallSign_Fjor should directly inquire with their friends to understand their perspective. The intent is to prompt CallSign_Fjor to seek more information directly from the friends involved.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: This act involves seeking information. The utterance is phrased as a question, prompting the original poster to consider whether they have directly asked their friends about the issue. 
   - **Invite**: This could be considered if the intent was to encourage CallSign_Fjor to engage in a conversation with their friends.
   - **Direct**: This could be considered if the speaker was commanding or advising CallSign_Fjor to take action by asking their friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The question is neutral in tone and does not include any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward inquiry without hedging or face-threatening elements.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in the question.

Given these considerations, the primary communicative act is best classified as **Inquire**, as the utterance is a direct question seeking information about whether CallSign_Fjor has asked their friends for an explanation.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n|-----|-------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise an accomplishment; Express confidence in future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that. First, ...

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Did you ask your friends?"" is a response to the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, who is expressing frustration and confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria and other games with them after they had progressed further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to be suggesting that CallSign_Fjor should directly inquire with their friends to understand their perspective. The intent is to prompt CallSign_Fjor to seek more information directly from the friends involved.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: This act involves seeking information. The utterance is phrased as a question, prompting the original poster to consider whether they have directly asked their friends about the issue. 
   - **Invite**: This could be considered if the intent was to encourage CallSign_Fjor to engage in a conversation with their friends.
   - **Direct**: This could be considered if the speaker was commanding or advising CallSign_Fjor to take action by asking their friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The question is neutral in tone and does not include any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward inquiry without hedging or face-threatening elements.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in the question.

Given these considerations, the primary communicative act is best classified as **Inquire**, as the utterance is a direct question seeking information about whether CallSign_Fjor has asked their friends for an explanation.

This is a response to CallSign_Fjor's query about why their friends lost interest in playing games with them after realizing CallSign_Fjor had progressed further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to suggest that the people who stopped playing (CallSign_Fjor's friends) are the best ones to answer the question about why they felt invalidated or lost interest. This implies that the answer lies with the friends themselves, not with external reasoning or assumptions.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: AurelianoTampa is responding to CallSign_Fjor's confusion about why friends lost interest in playing after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game. AurelianoTampa provides an explanation by drawing a parallel to watching a show with friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of AurelianoTampa is to offer an explanation for why CallSign_Fjor's friends might have lost interest. They are providing a perspective on why the friends' enjoyment might have been diminished.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information about the potential reasons why the friends lost interest. This is factual and can be verified in principle, as it is an explanation based on reasoning.
   - **Elaborate**: They could be seen as elaborating on CallSign_Fjor's situation by providing a detailed explanation.
   - **Claim**: There could be an element of subjectivity in the explanation, as it involves interpreting the friends' feelings and intentions.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone of the message is neutral and does not include any explicit politeness or impoliteness. The user is providing an explanation without attacking or supporting any party.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is sincere and straightforward.

The most fitting label is **Inform**, as AurelianoTampa is providing a reasoned explanation for the friends' behavior, which can be considered factual information in the context of interpersonal understanding.

9,1,250127,,wyldmage,,Exactly this.,AurelianoTampa,Reply,D7,7.0,Accept,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" by wyldmage is a direct reply to AurelianoTampa's preceding message, which suggests that the friends of the original poster (CallSign_Fjor) likely felt that playing the game together was meant to be a shared experience, and knowing that someone had already progressed independently diminished the enjoyment of a group experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: Wyldmage's utterance is a clear expression of agreement with AurelianoTampa's analysis. The phrase ""Exactly this."" is an acknowledgment and concurrence with the explanation provided in the preceding message.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Accept**: The utterance agrees with the explanation given by AurelianoTampa, which fits the definition of accepting or agreeing with a statement.
   - **React**: This act involves showing engagement or simple listenership, but ""Exactly this."" goes beyond mere reaction by explicitly agreeing with a specific explanation.
   - **Elaborate**: Wyldmage does not provide additional commentary or expansion on AurelianoTampa's explanation, so this option is less appropriate.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not convey any specific politeness or impoliteness. It is a neutral agreement without any additional positive or negative politeness markers.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm. The statement is straightforward and sincere.

The most appropriate communicative act label for ""Exactly this."" is **Accept**, as it is concurring with the previous user's explanation.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n|-----|-------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise an accomplishment; Express confidence in future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.)

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" by wyldmage is a direct reply to AurelianoTampa's preceding message, which suggests that the friends of the original poster (CallSign_Fjor) likely felt that playing the game together was meant to be a shared experience, and knowing that someone had already progressed independently diminished the enjoyment of a group experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: Wyldmage's utterance is a clear expression of agreement with AurelianoTampa's analysis. The phrase ""Exactly this."" is an acknowledgment and concurrence with the explanation provided in the preceding message.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Accept**: The utterance agrees with the explanation given by AurelianoTampa, which fits the definition of accepting or agreeing with a statement.
   - **React**: This act involves showing engagement or simple listenership, but ""Exactly this."" goes beyond mere reaction by explicitly agreeing with a specific explanation.
   - **Elaborate**: Wyldmage does not provide additional commentary or expansion on AurelianoTampa's explanation, so this option is less appropriate.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not convey any specific politeness or impoliteness. It is a neutral agreement without any additional positive or negative politeness markers.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm. The statement is straightforward and sincere.

The most appropriate communicative act label for ""Exactly this."" is **Accept**, as it is concurring with the previous user's explanation.

His friends value ""exploring a game with friends"".",AurelianoTampa,Reply,D7,7.0,Claim,,,"1. **Reading the Target Utterance in Context**: The utterance by wyldmage is: ""OP values 'playing a game with friends'. His friends value 'exploring a game with friends'."" This is a reply to a comment suggesting that the OP's friends wanted to experience the game together rather than just playing it with someone who already knows everything.

2. **Identifying the Speaker's Primary Communicative Intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is attempting to provide an explanation or interpretation of the situation described by the OP. They are offering a perspective on the difference in values between the OP and their friends, suggesting that the mismatch in expectations may be the root cause of the issue.

3. **Consider 2-3 Most Plausible Act Options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the values held by the OP and their friends. However, the use of quotation marks around the values suggests that these are interpretations or characterizations rather than objective facts.
   - **Claim**: Wyldmage is making a subjective assertion about the underlying motivations and values of the OP and their friends. This is an interpretation based on the context provided, not something objectively verifiable.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as an elaboration on AurelianoTampa's previous message, providing further insight into why the friends might feel the way they do.

4. **Evaluating Politeness/Impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It's a neutral explanation without any hedging, support, or confrontation.

5. **Checking for Meta-acts**: The utterance is not reported speech, nor does it contain sarcasm or irony. It is a straightforward explanation.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting label for the act is ""Claim"", as wyldmage is offering an interpretation of the motivations and values of the OP and their friends, which is subjective and not verifiable.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n|-----|-------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise an accomplishment; Express confidence in future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that. First, ... Second, ...\""; \""That's my final word on the matter.\"" |\n| **React** | Show simple listenership, engagement (positive, negative, or neutral) | \""That's great/terrible!\""; \""hahaha\""; \""lmao\""; \""wow\""; \""hmm\""; \""ugh\""; \""yeah\"" |\n| **Reject** | Disagree, dispute, challenge; insult | \""No way is that accurate.\""; \""Gayyyy\"" |\n| **Repair** | Clarify or seek clarification; correct misunderstanding | \""Did you mean 'school holiday'?\""; \""Just kidding.\"" |\n| **Request** | Seek action politely, make direct or indirect request | \""Can you plz send pics?\""; \""Would you mind sharing the link?\"" |\n| **Thank** | Appreciate, express gratitude | \""Thanks so much.\""; \""It's very nice of you to offer.\"" |\n\n## Meta-Acts\n\n| Tag | Description | Examples |\n|-----|-------------|----------|\n| **[reported]** | In the case of reported acts, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most relevant for act analysis, in which case the act code is assigned to it, rather than to the matrix (embedding) clause. | \""She said she wants to go.\"" → code DESIRE [reported] |\n| **[non-bona fide]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith. In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.
