1.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"" is a question posed by the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, on Reddit. The context is a discussion about why friends might lose interest in playing a game when one person progresses faster.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker seems to be seeking an explanation or understanding of a phenomenon they have observed—people losing interest in a game when someone else progresses further. This suggests that the primary intent is to seek information or insight from others.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is structured as a question and appears to be seeking information or an explanation from the community.
   - **Claim**: It might be seen as a rhetorical device to express confusion or disbelief about the situation, but the structure and context suggest a genuine inquiry.
   - **React**: The utterance could also be interpreted as expressing surprise or frustration, but the question format leans more toward seeking an answer.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no strong indication of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It appears to be a neutral inquiry.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or any obvious non-bona fide elements like sarcasm. It seems to be a bona fide question seeking genuine answers.

Given the question format and the context of seeking understanding, the most appropriate act is **Inquire**.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

2.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). ,,Original post,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**:  
   The target utterance provides a narrative of CallSign_Fjor's actions in the game Terraria with their friends. The user describes how they played the game solo and progressed significantly, then returned to play with friends without using advanced gear. They shared extra resources with friends, which led to a comment about having extra items.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**:  
   The primary intent of the utterance is to inform the audience about the situation that unfolded while playing Terraria with friends. CallSign_Fjor explains the sequence of events that led to a change in dynamics with their friends, focusing on their actions and the resulting observations.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker provides detailed information about their actions in the game and the situation with their friends. The content is factual and verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: While there is a subjective element to the speaker's perspective, the utterance primarily focuses on describing events rather than expressing unverifiable opinions or feelings.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**:  
   There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting events without any apparent intention to enhance or attack the addressees' face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**:  
   The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements like sarcasm or irony. It is a straightforward narrative.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate communicative act for the utterance is ""Inform,"" as it primarily serves to provide factual information about the speaker's actions and the situation in the game.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**:  
   The target utterance provides a narrative of CallSign_Fjor's actions in the game Terraria with their friends. The user describes how they played the game solo and progressed significantly, then returned to play with friends without using advanced gear. They shared extra resources with friends, which led to a comment about having extra items.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**:  
   The primary intent of the utterance is to inform the audience about the situation that unfolded while playing Terraria with friends. CallSign_Fjor explains the sequence of events that led to a change in dynamics with their friends, focusing on their actions and the resulting observations.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker provides detailed information about their actions in the game and the situation with their friends. The content is factual and verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: While there is a subjective element to the speaker's perspective, the utterance primarily focuses on describing events rather than expressing unverifiable opinions or feelings.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**:  
   There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting events without any apparent intention to enhance or attack the addressees' face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**:  
   The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements like sarcasm or irony. It is a straightforward narrative.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate communicative act for the utterance is ""Inform,"" as it primarily serves to provide factual information about the speaker's actions and the situation in the game.

",,,Inform,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" is part of a larger narrative where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, describes a situation where their friends lost interest in a game after learning that CallSign_Fjor had completed it alone.  
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is explaining a sequence of events that led to their friends losing interest in the game. The intent is to provide factual information about the reaction of the friends after being told about the speaker's solo progress.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the friends' reaction after being informed about the speaker's progress.  
   - **Claim**: While the speaker shares their perspective, the content is more factual than subjective, as it recounts a specific event and reaction.  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on a previous statement, but it primarily serves to inform about the friends' reaction.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting an event.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance includes reported speech (""When I told them""), indicating that the primary act of informing is based on a reported event. This requires the use of the [reported] meta-act tag.  

The primary communicative act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing factual information about their friends' reaction to being told about the game's completion. The [reported] meta-act tag is applicable due to the indirect reporting of what was said to the friends.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" is part of a larger narrative where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, describes a situation where their friends lost interest in a game after learning that CallSign_Fjor had completed it alone.  
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is explaining a sequence of events that led to their friends losing interest in the game. The intent is to provide factual information about the reaction of the friends after being told about the speaker's solo progress.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the friends' reaction after being informed about the speaker's progress.  
   - **Claim**: While the speaker shares their perspective, the content is more factual than subjective, as it recounts a specific event and reaction.  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on a previous statement, but it primarily serves to inform about the friends' reaction.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting an event.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance includes reported speech (""When I told them""), indicating that the primary act of informing is based on a reported event. This requires the use of the [reported] meta-act tag.  

The primary communicative act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing factual information about their friends' reaction to being told about the game's completion. The [reported] meta-act tag is applicable due to the indirect reporting of what was said to the friends.

2.0,3.0,,,CallSign_Fjor,,It's been a week ,,,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""It's been a week"" is part of a longer message where CallSign_Fjor explains their friends' lack of interest in continuing to play Terraria after they progressed further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the utterance ""It's been a week"" seems to be to provide factual information about the duration since the friends last participated in the game. This is meant to emphasize the point that the friends' lack of interest has persisted over time, which supports the speaker's narrative about their friends' disengagement.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the time that has elapsed since the friends last played, which is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: If considered as expressing a subjective viewpoint about the length of time, but the context suggests a more factual recounting.
   - **React**: Could be seen as expressing frustration or disappointment, but the primary function is informational.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this short factual statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance.

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""It's been a week"" is part of a longer message where CallSign_Fjor explains their friends' lack of interest in continuing to play Terraria after they progressed further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the utterance ""It's been a week"" seems to be to provide factual information about the duration since the friends last participated in the game. This is meant to emphasize the point that the friends' lack of interest has persisted over time, which supports the speaker's narrative about their friends' disengagement.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the time that has elapsed since the friends last played, which is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: If considered as expressing a subjective viewpoint about the length of time, but the context suggests a more factual recounting.
   - **React**: Could be seen as expressing frustration or disappointment, but the primary function is informational.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this short factual statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance.

Given the context and the nature of the utterance, the most appropriate label is **Inform**.

2.0,4.0,,,CallSign_Fjor,,and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.,,,Inform,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" is part of a longer explanation by CallSign_Fjor about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them. The context is about understanding why the friends felt discouraged.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is reporting the reason their friends gave for not wanting to continue playing the game. The use of ""excuse"" implies some skepticism or dismissal of the reason given by the friends, but the primary function is to convey the content of what the friends said.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friends said, even if the speaker personally views it as an ""excuse.""  
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be asserting their interpretation of the friends' reason as an ""excuse,"" but this is secondary to the act of conveying the information.  
   - **Reject**: While ""excuse"" suggests dismissal, the primary focus is on reporting the friends' statement rather than directly rejecting it.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The use of ""excuse"" could imply a lack of positive politeness, as it suggests the speaker doesn't fully respect the friends' reasoning. However, it doesn't rise to the level of clear impoliteness in this context.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: This is an example of reported speech, as the speaker is conveying what the friends have said.

Considering the above analysis, the primary communicative act is **Inform** with the meta-act **reported**. There is no strong politeness or impoliteness marker.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" is part of a longer explanation by CallSign_Fjor about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them. The context is about understanding why the friends felt discouraged.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is reporting the reason their friends gave for not wanting to continue playing the game. The use of ""excuse"" implies some skepticism or dismissal of the reason given by the friends, but the primary function is to convey the content of what the friends said.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friends said, even if the speaker personally views it as an ""excuse.""  
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be asserting their interpretation of the friends' reason as an ""excuse,"" but this is secondary to the act of conveying the information.  
   - **Reject**: While ""excuse"" suggests dismissal, the primary focus is on reporting the friends' statement rather than directly rejecting it.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The use of ""excuse"" could imply a lack of positive politeness, as it suggests the speaker doesn't fully respect the friends' reasoning. However, it doesn't rise to the level of clear impoliteness in this context.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: This is an example of reported speech, as the speaker is conveying what the friends have said.

Considering the above analysis, the primary communicative act is **Inform** with the meta-act **reported**. There is no strong politeness or impoliteness marker.

3.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.,,Original post,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is: ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources."" The user, CallSign_Fjor, is describing a past situation where a similar issue occurred with another player quitting due to the user's actions in a game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The user seems to be explaining a past experience to illustrate a point about players feeling invalidated by someone else's progression in a game. The primary intent is to provide information about a previous occurrence to support the broader question or complaint about player behavior.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about a past event, which is verifiable in principle. This is the most straightforward interpretation.
   - **Claim**: The user might be asserting their perspective or feelings about the situation, but the focus here is more on the factual recounting of past events rather than subjective assertions.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on the previous statement about similar occurrences, but the primary function is still to inform.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The user is neutrally describing past events.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The user is directly recounting their own past actions and experiences.  

Considering these points, the most fitting communicative act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing factual information about a previous incident to illustrate their point about player behavior.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is: ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources."" The user, CallSign_Fjor, is describing a past situation where a similar issue occurred with another player quitting due to the user's actions in a game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The user seems to be explaining a past experience to illustrate a point about players feeling invalidated by someone else's progression in a game. The primary intent is to provide information about a previous occurrence to support the broader question or complaint about player behavior.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about a past event, which is verifiable in principle. This is the most straightforward interpretation.
   - **Claim**: The user might be asserting their perspective or feelings about the situation, but the focus here is more on the factual recounting of past events rather than subjective assertions.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on the previous statement about similar occurrences, but the primary function is still to inform.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The user is neutrally describing past events.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The user is directly recounting their own past actions and experiences.  

Considering these points, the most fitting communicative act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing factual information about a previous incident to illustrate their point about player behavior.

3.0,2.0,,,CallSign_Fjor,,Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,,Inform,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" is part of a larger message where CallSign_Fjor is discussing their experience with friends who lost interest in playing a game because of CallSign_Fjor's advanced progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining the perspective or stance of their friends. They are not making a direct claim or expressing their own feelings but rather reporting how their friends perceived the situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about what the friends' stance was. This fits the definition of informing, as it is providing information that is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: This could be considered a claim if it were interpreted as CallSign_Fjor's subjective assertion about the situation. However, since it is about the friends' stance, it is more about reporting their perspective.
   - **Reported**: The structure of the sentence indicates that CallSign_Fjor is reporting the stance of their friends, which aligns with the concept of reported speech.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement about the stance of others.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is a classic example of reported speech, as it conveys the viewpoint of the friends rather than CallSign_Fjor's own perspective.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate act is **Inform** with a meta-act of **reported**.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" is part of a larger message where CallSign_Fjor is discussing their experience with friends who lost interest in playing a game because of CallSign_Fjor's advanced progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining the perspective or stance of their friends. They are not making a direct claim or expressing their own feelings but rather reporting how their friends perceived the situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about what the friends' stance was. This fits the definition of informing, as it is providing information that is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: This could be considered a claim if it were interpreted as CallSign_Fjor's subjective assertion about the situation. However, since it is about the friends' stance, it is more about reporting their perspective.
   - **Reported**: The structure of the sentence indicates that CallSign_Fjor is reporting the stance of their friends, which aligns with the concept of reported speech.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement about the stance of others.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is a classic example of reported speech, as it conveys the viewpoint of the friends rather than CallSign_Fjor's own perspective.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate act is **Inform** with a meta-act of **reported**.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?",,Original post,Claim,,non-bona fide,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is expressing confusion about why their actions in a game, specifically progressing faster and gathering resources, would discourage others from playing. They are questioning why others would feel invalidated by their progression. The utterance consists of two rhetorical questions that express this confusion.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent here is to express a lack of understanding regarding the behavior of others. The speaker is not genuinely seeking answers to their questions but is instead using the questions to highlight their confusion and disbelief.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inquire**: The surface form of the utterance is a question, which typically would indicate an inquiry. However, given the context and the rhetorical nature of the questions, this does not seem to be the primary intent.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their lack of understanding, which is unverifiable and reflects their personal state of mind.
   - **React**: The utterance could be seen as a reaction to the situation, but it is more about expressing a personal stance rather than showing engagement with someone else's statement.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is neither affirming nor attacking anyone's face needs.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The rhetorical nature of the questions suggests non-bona fide communication. The speaker is not seeking information but is instead using questions to make a point about their confusion.  

Given the rhetorical nature of the questions and the expression of personal confusion, the most fitting act is **Claim**, with a meta-act of **non-bona fide** due to the rhetorical questions.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is expressing confusion about why their actions in a game, specifically progressing faster and gathering resources, would discourage others from playing. They are questioning why others would feel invalidated by their progression. The utterance consists of two rhetorical questions that express this confusion.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent here is to express a lack of understanding regarding the behavior of others. The speaker is not genuinely seeking answers to their questions but is instead using the questions to highlight their confusion and disbelief.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inquire**: The surface form of the utterance is a question, which typically would indicate an inquiry. However, given the context and the rhetorical nature of the questions, this does not seem to be the primary intent.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their lack of understanding, which is unverifiable and reflects their personal state of mind.
   - **React**: The utterance could be seen as a reaction to the situation, but it is more about expressing a personal stance rather than showing engagement with someone else's statement.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is neither affirming nor attacking anyone's face needs.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The rhetorical nature of the questions suggests non-bona fide communication. The speaker is not seeking information but is instead using questions to make a point about their confusion.  

Given the rhetorical nature of the questions and the expression of personal confusion, the most fitting act is **Claim**, with a meta-act of **non-bona fide** due to the rhetorical questions.

There was a time when a player ""had the thing"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.",,Original post,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance from CallSign_Fjor is a reflection on why people might feel discouraged by someone else's progression in a game. The user is expressing confusion about this mentality and contrasts it with a past perspective where having advanced items meant prestige.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary intent seems to be expressing a subjective opinion or belief about the mentality of other players. They are not directly seeking information or providing factual data, but rather sharing a personal view on the situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making an assertion about their own understanding and the mentality of others, which is inherently subjective.
   - **Inquire**: Although there is an element of questioning (""I do not understand""), the primary function is not to seek information but to express confusion.
   - **React**: The utterance also contains an element of reaction to the situation, showing engagement with the topic.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is not addressing anyone directly or making any evaluative comments about others' actions in a way that would imply politeness or impoliteness.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide elements such as sarcasm in the utterance. The expression is straightforward.

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance from CallSign_Fjor is a reflection on why people might feel discouraged by someone else's progression in a game. The user is expressing confusion about this mentality and contrasts it with a past perspective where having advanced items meant prestige.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary intent seems to be expressing a subjective opinion or belief about the mentality of other players. They are not directly seeking information or providing factual data, but rather sharing a personal view on the situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making an assertion about their own understanding and the mentality of others, which is inherently subjective.
   - **Inquire**: Although there is an element of questioning (""I do not understand""), the primary function is not to seek information but to express confusion.
   - **React**: The utterance also contains an element of reaction to the situation, showing engagement with the topic.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is not addressing anyone directly or making any evaluative comments about others' actions in a way that would imply politeness or impoliteness.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide elements such as sarcasm in the utterance. The expression is straightforward.

Given the emphasis on subjective understanding and opinion, the most fitting act is ""Claim"".

6.0,1.0,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,Did you ask your friends? ,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Did you ask your friends?"" is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game. The post expresses confusion about why friends feel invalidated by someone else's progression in a game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa's question seems to be aimed at prompting CallSign_Fjor to consider whether they have directly communicated with their friends about the issue. The intent appears to be to encourage CallSign_Fjor to seek information directly from their friends to better understand their perspective.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is phrased as a question, seeking information about whether CallSign_Fjor has communicated with their friends about their feelings.
   - **Request**: It could be interpreted as a subtle suggestion for CallSign_Fjor to ask their friends, but the phrasing as a question leans more towards seeking information rather than directly requesting an action.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The question is neutral in tone and does not convey any clear politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward inquiry.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication that this is reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The question appears sincere and straightforward.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is ""Inquire"" as it seeks information from CallSign_Fjor.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Did you ask your friends?"" is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game. The post expresses confusion about why friends feel invalidated by someone else's progression in a game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa's question seems to be aimed at prompting CallSign_Fjor to consider whether they have directly communicated with their friends about the issue. The intent appears to be to encourage CallSign_Fjor to seek information directly from their friends to better understand their perspective.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is phrased as a question, seeking information about whether CallSign_Fjor has communicated with their friends about their feelings.
   - **Request**: It could be interpreted as a subtle suggestion for CallSign_Fjor to ask their friends, but the phrasing as a question leans more towards seeking information rather than directly requesting an action.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The question is neutral in tone and does not convey any clear politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward inquiry.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication that this is reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The question appears sincere and straightforward.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is ""Inquire"" as it seeks information from CallSign_Fjor.

7.0,1.0,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,They'd be the ones with the answer.,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Manage,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context:** The utterance ""They'd be the ones with the answer."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's series of questions and expressions of confusion about why friends lose interest in playing games when someone else has progressed further. The original post is seeking understanding of this behavior.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent:** The primary intent of AurelianoTampa is to suggest that the friends themselves, who have lost interest, are the ones who can best explain their own behavior. This shifts the responsibility of explanation back to the friends, indicating that they are the ones who hold the answer to the original poster's questions.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options:**
   - **Inform:** The utterance provides information about who can answer the original poster's question, though it doesn't provide new factual information.
   - **Manage:** The utterance helps manage the discourse by directing the original poster to consider asking the friends directly for answers.
   - **Invite:** It could be seen as suggesting the original poster seek further input from the friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed:** There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is neutral in tone and does not directly address the original poster's feelings or autonomy.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.):** There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm or irony in this utterance.

The most fitting act is **Manage**, as it serves to direct the original poster towards a course of action that might resolve their confusion by suggesting they seek answers directly from their friends.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context:** The utterance ""They'd be the ones with the answer."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's series of questions and expressions of confusion about why friends lose interest in playing games when someone else has progressed further. The original post is seeking understanding of this behavior.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent:** The primary intent of AurelianoTampa is to suggest that the friends themselves, who have lost interest, are the ones who can best explain their own behavior. This shifts the responsibility of explanation back to the friends, indicating that they are the ones who hold the answer to the original poster's questions.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options:**
   - **Inform:** The utterance provides information about who can answer the original poster's question, though it doesn't provide new factual information.
   - **Manage:** The utterance helps manage the discourse by directing the original poster to consider asking the friends directly for answers.
   - **Invite:** It could be seen as suggesting the original poster seek further input from the friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed:** There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is neutral in tone and does not directly address the original poster's feelings or autonomy.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.):** There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm or irony in this utterance.

The most fitting act is **Manage**, as it serves to direct the original poster towards a course of action that might resolve their confusion by suggesting they seek answers directly from their friends.

Knowing you had already gone through everything and now were just kinda babysitting them probably took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable. ",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user AurelianoTampa is responding to CallSign_Fjor's question about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria together after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game. The response suggests that the friends wanted a shared discovery experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa seems to be providing an explanation or interpretation of the situation from an outsider's perspective. The goal is to help CallSign_Fjor understand why their friends reacted the way they did.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information based on their interpretation of the situation. They explain why the friends might have lost interest.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on CallSign_Fjor's confusion about their friends' behavior, offering a more detailed perspective.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the situation, which is not verifiable but rather an opinion or interpretation.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The tone is neutral and explanatory.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is delivered in a straightforward manner without any sarcasm or reported speech. It is a direct interpretation of the situation.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the primary communicative act is best categorized as **Claim**. AurelianoTampa is providing their personal interpretation of the situation, which is subjective and based on their perspective as an outsider.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user AurelianoTampa is responding to CallSign_Fjor's question about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria together after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game. The response suggests that the friends wanted a shared discovery experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa seems to be providing an explanation or interpretation of the situation from an outsider's perspective. The goal is to help CallSign_Fjor understand why their friends reacted the way they did.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information based on their interpretation of the situation. They explain why the friends might have lost interest.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on CallSign_Fjor's confusion about their friends' behavior, offering a more detailed perspective.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the situation, which is not verifiable but rather an opinion or interpretation.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The tone is neutral and explanatory.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is delivered in a straightforward manner without any sarcasm or reported speech. It is a direct interpretation of the situation.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the primary communicative act is best categorized as **Claim**. AurelianoTampa is providing their personal interpretation of the situation, which is subjective and based on their perspective as an outsider.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is attempting to explain the friends' perspective to CallSign_Fjor. The goal is to provide insight into why the friends might have felt discouraged when CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game independently.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the friends' desires, which is verifiable in principle. The speaker is explaining a possible reason for their behavior.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be seen as a subjective assertion or opinion about what the friends wanted.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is elaborating on the idea that playing as a group is important, building on the broader context of the previous discussion.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance indirectly reports the friends' desires without quoting them directly. This could be considered a form of reported speech.

Considering the context and the nature of the utterance, the most fitting communicative act is ""Inform,"" as the speaker is providing an explanation that could be seen as factual within the context of the friends' behavior.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They wanted a new experience as a group,"" which is part of a response to CallSign_Fjor's query about why friends lose interest in playing games when someone progresses faster.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is attempting to explain the friends' perspective to CallSign_Fjor. The goal is to provide insight into why the friends might have felt discouraged when CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game independently.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the friends' desires, which is verifiable in principle. The speaker is explaining a possible reason for their behavior.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be seen as a subjective assertion or opinion about what the friends wanted.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is elaborating on the idea that playing as a group is important, building on the broader context of the previous discussion.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance indirectly reports the friends' desires without quoting them directly. This could be considered a form of reported speech.

Considering the context and the nature of the utterance, the most fitting communicative act is ""Inform,"" as the speaker is providing an explanation that could be seen as factual within the context of the friends' behavior.

The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is explaining why CallSign_Fjor's friends might have felt discouraged.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the utterance is to highlight an action taken by CallSign_Fjor that might have led to the friends' disinterest. It serves as a statement of fact or observation about the situation, pointing out that CallSign_Fjor experienced the game independently rather than with the group.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about CallSign_Fjor's actions, which is likely verifiable and factual.  
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be seen as expressing the speaker's subjective view or interpretation of the situation.  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance might be expanding on a previous point made in the message about the effect of CallSign_Fjor's actions on the group experience.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this specific utterance. It is a neutral statement focusing on the actions of CallSign_Fjor.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement.  

Based on the context and the nature of the utterance, the most fitting act is **Inform**, as it provides factual information about what CallSign_Fjor did, which could be verified by the participants in the conversation.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""and you went and had the experience on your own."" is part of a larger message from AurelianoTampa responding to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in games when one person progresses faster. The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is explaining why CallSign_Fjor's friends might have felt discouraged.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the utterance is to highlight an action taken by CallSign_Fjor that might have led to the friends' disinterest. It serves as a statement of fact or observation about the situation, pointing out that CallSign_Fjor experienced the game independently rather than with the group.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about CallSign_Fjor's actions, which is likely verifiable and factual.  
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be seen as expressing the speaker's subjective view or interpretation of the situation.  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance might be expanding on a previous point made in the message about the effect of CallSign_Fjor's actions on the group experience.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this specific utterance. It is a neutral statement focusing on the actions of CallSign_Fjor.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement.  

Based on the context and the nature of the utterance, the most fitting act is **Inform**, as it provides factual information about what CallSign_Fjor did, which could be verified by the participants in the conversation.

8.0,4.0,,,AurelianoTampa,,"Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going ""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!"" ",CallSign_Fjor,,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going 'Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!'"" is part of a reply by AurelianoTampa to CallSign_Fjor. The context involves CallSign_Fjor expressing confusion over friends losing interest in gaming together after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game individually.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa is trying to provide an analogy to help CallSign_Fjor understand why their friends might have lost interest. The analogy compares the gaming situation to watching a TV show where one friend has already seen the episodes, potentially spoiling the experience for others.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: AurelianoTampa is expressing a subjective viewpoint or speculation about the situation.
   - **Elaborate**: The analogy is expanding on a previous point made in the message, attempting to explain the situation.
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information through the analogy about a potential reason for the friends' behavior.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this analogy. It is presented neutrally to help explain a perspective.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance includes a hypothetical scenario but is not non-bona fide or reported speech. The analogy is sincere in its attempt to explain the situation.

Given the context and the construction of the analogy, the primary act is best categorized as a **Claim**. AurelianoTampa is speculating about the situation by drawing a parallel to a common experience, thereby making a subjective assertion.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going 'Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!'"" is part of a reply by AurelianoTampa to CallSign_Fjor. The context involves CallSign_Fjor expressing confusion over friends losing interest in gaming together after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the game individually.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa is trying to provide an analogy to help CallSign_Fjor understand why their friends might have lost interest. The analogy compares the gaming situation to watching a TV show where one friend has already seen the episodes, potentially spoiling the experience for others.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: AurelianoTampa is expressing a subjective viewpoint or speculation about the situation.
   - **Elaborate**: The analogy is expanding on a previous point made in the message, attempting to explain the situation.
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information through the analogy about a potential reason for the friends' behavior.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this analogy. It is presented neutrally to help explain a perspective.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance includes a hypothetical scenario but is not non-bona fide or reported speech. The analogy is sincere in its attempt to explain the situation.

Given the context and the construction of the analogy, the primary act is best categorized as a **Claim**. AurelianoTampa is speculating about the situation by drawing a parallel to a common experience, thereby making a subjective assertion.

8.0,5.0,,,AurelianoTampa,,It ruins the surprise.,CallSign_Fjor,,Elaborate,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""It ruins the surprise."" is part of a longer explanation provided by AurelianoTampa in response to CallSign_Fjor's question about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria after they progressed further in the game. AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together and that CallSign_Fjor's prior experience took away from the collective experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the utterance ""It ruins the surprise."" is to explain or clarify why CallSign_Fjor's friends might feel less interested in continuing the game. It serves as a conclusion to the analogy of watching a show with friends, where one person has already seen the episodes. The focus is on the impact of prior knowledge on the group's shared experience.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on the previous analogy, further explaining how prior knowledge affects the experience.
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the negative impact of having one person know more than the others in a shared activity.
   - **Claim**: It could be viewed as a subjective assertion about the nature of surprise and shared experiences.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral explanation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not involve reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a straightforward explanation.

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""It ruins the surprise."" is part of a longer explanation provided by AurelianoTampa in response to CallSign_Fjor's question about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria after they progressed further in the game. AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together and that CallSign_Fjor's prior experience took away from the collective experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the utterance ""It ruins the surprise."" is to explain or clarify why CallSign_Fjor's friends might feel less interested in continuing the game. It serves as a conclusion to the analogy of watching a show with friends, where one person has already seen the episodes. The focus is on the impact of prior knowledge on the group's shared experience.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as elaborating on the previous analogy, further explaining how prior knowledge affects the experience.
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the negative impact of having one person know more than the others in a shared activity.
   - **Claim**: It could be viewed as a subjective assertion about the nature of surprise and shared experiences.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral explanation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not involve reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a straightforward explanation.

Given the context and the primary intent of providing an explanation or clarification, the most appropriate act is **Elaborate**.

9.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,Exactly this.,AurelianoTampa,Reply,Accept,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" is a response by wyldmage to AurelianoTampa's explanation of why friends might lose interest when one person in the group progresses faster in a game. AurelianoTampa suggests that it might be because the friends wanted a shared experience and felt the surprise was ruined by the faster progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""Exactly this."" is a form of concurrence or agreement with what AurelianoTampa has said. Wyldmage is expressing that they fully agree with the explanation given by AurelianoTampa.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Accept**: This act involves agreeing or concurring with someone else's statement. ""Exactly this."" is a clear expression of agreement with AurelianoTampa's comments.
   - **React**: Although this act involves engagement, ""Exactly this."" is more specific in showing agreement rather than a general reaction.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The statement does not include any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward expression of agreement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance. It appears sincere and direct.

Given the analysis, the primary communicative act of the utterance ""Exactly this."" is to express agreement with the previous message, making ""Accept"" the most appropriate label. There are no politeness or meta-act markers to annotate.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" is a response by wyldmage to AurelianoTampa's explanation of why friends might lose interest when one person in the group progresses faster in a game. AurelianoTampa suggests that it might be because the friends wanted a shared experience and felt the surprise was ruined by the faster progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""Exactly this."" is a form of concurrence or agreement with what AurelianoTampa has said. Wyldmage is expressing that they fully agree with the explanation given by AurelianoTampa.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Accept**: This act involves agreeing or concurring with someone else's statement. ""Exactly this."" is a clear expression of agreement with AurelianoTampa's comments.
   - **React**: Although this act involves engagement, ""Exactly this."" is more specific in showing agreement rather than a general reaction.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The statement does not include any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward expression of agreement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance. It appears sincere and direct.

Given the analysis, the primary communicative act of the utterance ""Exactly this."" is to express agreement with the previous message, making ""Accept"" the most appropriate label. There are no politeness or meta-act markers to annotate.

His friends value ""exploring a game with friends"".",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance from wyldmage is ""OP values 'playing a game with friends'. His friends value 'exploring a game with friends'."" This is a response to AurelianoTampa's comments on why OP's friends might have lost interest in playing together after OP progressed solo. The utterance attempts to clarify or summarize the different motivations or priorities between OP and their friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent seems to be to explain or clarify the difference in values between OP and their friends. Wyldmage is interpreting or analyzing the situation by stating what each party values in the context of playing games.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the differing values between OP and the friends. It is a factual statement about what wyldmage perceives as the situation.
   - **Claim**: Since the statement reflects wyldmage's interpretation of OP's and the friends' motivations, it could also be seen as a subjective assertion or opinion.
   - **Elaborate**: It builds on AurelianoTampa's previous comments about the friends' experience being spoiled, further explaining the dynamics.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is a neutral statement aimed at explaining or clarifying a situation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The quotation marks around ""playing a game with friends"" and ""exploring a game with friends"" are used to emphasize the distinct values but do not indicate reported speech.

Given that the utterance is providing an interpretation of the situation, the most fitting act is **Claim**, as it reflects wyldmage's subjective understanding of the differing values.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #10.0 from wyldmage:\n\""OP values \""playing a game with friends\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance from wyldmage is ""OP values 'playing a game with friends'. His friends value 'exploring a game with friends'."" This is a response to AurelianoTampa's comments on why OP's friends might have lost interest in playing together after OP progressed solo. The utterance attempts to clarify or summarize the different motivations or priorities between OP and their friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent seems to be to explain or clarify the difference in values between OP and their friends. Wyldmage is interpreting or analyzing the situation by stating what each party values in the context of playing games.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the differing values between OP and the friends. It is a factual statement about what wyldmage perceives as the situation.
   - **Claim**: Since the statement reflects wyldmage's interpretation of OP's and the friends' motivations, it could also be seen as a subjective assertion or opinion.
   - **Elaborate**: It builds on AurelianoTampa's previous comments about the friends' experience being spoiled, further explaining the dynamics.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is a neutral statement aimed at explaining or clarifying a situation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The quotation marks around ""playing a game with friends"" and ""exploring a game with friends"" are used to emphasize the distinct values but do not indicate reported speech.

Given that the utterance is providing an interpretation of the situation, the most fitting act is **Claim**, as it reflects wyldmage's subjective understanding of the differing values.

11.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,"They aren't the same, and OP discovered the key difference.",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Accept,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They aren't the same, and OP discovered the key difference."" It is a reply to AurelianoTampa's comments about why the original poster's (OP) friends might have lost interest in playing games with them. AurelianoTampa suggested that it might be because the friends wanted to experience the game together, and the OP having already experienced it took away from the group experience.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, seems to be agreeing with AurelianoTampa's analysis and pointing out that the OP realized a critical distinction in their situation. The utterance seems to acknowledge a difference between OP's perspective and their friends' expectations.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Accept**: The utterance can be seen as concurring with AurelianoTampa's analysis by acknowledging a key difference discovered by the OP.
   - **Inform**: It could be interpreted as providing a statement that OP has discovered an important difference, but it's more about acknowledging than providing new factual information.
   - **Claim**: This could be an assertion about OP's realization, but it lacks the subjective or speculative nature typical of claims.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement that neither enhances nor attacks anyone's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in this utterance. It appears to be a straightforward statement.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the primary communicative act is best described as **Accept**, as it concurs with the analysis provided by AurelianoTampa and acknowledges the key difference identified by OP.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #11.0 from wyldmage:\n\""They aren't the same, and OP discovered the key difference.\""\nThe full message is:\nThey aren't the same, and OP discovered the key difference.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""They aren't the same, and OP discovered the key difference.\"".\nUtterance #11.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They aren't the same, and OP discovered the key difference."" It is a reply to AurelianoTampa's comments about why the original poster's (OP) friends might have lost interest in playing games with them. AurelianoTampa suggested that it might be because the friends wanted to experience the game together, and the OP having already experienced it took away from the group experience.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, seems to be agreeing with AurelianoTampa's analysis and pointing out that the OP realized a critical distinction in their situation. The utterance seems to acknowledge a difference between OP's perspective and their friends' expectations.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Accept**: The utterance can be seen as concurring with AurelianoTampa's analysis by acknowledging a key difference discovered by the OP.
   - **Inform**: It could be interpreted as providing a statement that OP has discovered an important difference, but it's more about acknowledging than providing new factual information.
   - **Claim**: This could be an assertion about OP's realization, but it lacks the subjective or speculative nature typical of claims.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement that neither enhances nor attacks anyone's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in this utterance. It appears to be a straightforward statement.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the primary communicative act is best described as **Accept**, as it concurs with the analysis provided by AurelianoTampa and acknowledges the key difference identified by OP.

12.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,"Even worse, if your friend that has finished a game invites you to play it, you go in with the understanding that they are replaying it. ",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Elaborate,,,"1. **Contextual Reading**: The target utterance is ""Even worse, if your friend that has finished a game invites you to play it, you go in with the understanding that they are replaying it."" This is a continuation of a discussion about why some players might feel discouraged when playing games with others who have progressed further. The previous messages by AurelianoTampa suggest that friends might feel less engaged if they know someone else has already experienced the game.

2. **Speaker's Intent**: The primary communicative intent of the speaker, wyldmage, seems to be to elaborate on the situation described by AurelianoTampa. Wyldmage is adding a perspective that when a person who has finished a game invites others to play, there's an inherent understanding that the inviter is replaying the game, which could affect the dynamics and enjoyment of the others.

3. **Plausible Act Options**:  
   - **Elaborate**: Wyldmage is expanding on the previous point about how prior experience with a game can impact group dynamics.  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about a common understanding or expectation in gaming contexts.  
   - **Claim**: It could be seen as wyldmage's subjective assertion about the social dynamics of gaming.  

4. **Choosing the Primary Act**: The utterance is primarily serving to elaborate on the previous comments by providing additional context and explanation. It fits well under ""Elaborate"" because it's building on the previous discussion about gaming experiences and expectations.

5. **Politeness/Impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is neutral in tone.

6. **Meta-Acts**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a straightforward elaboration.

Given the context and the content, ""Elaborate"" is the most fitting act.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #12.0 from wyldmage:\n\""Even worse, if your friend that has finished a game invites you to play it, you go in with the understanding that they are replaying it.\""\nThe full message is:\nEven worse, if your friend that has finished a game invites you to play it, you go in with the understanding that they are replaying it.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""Even worse, if your friend that has finished a game invites you to play it, you go in with the understanding that they are replaying it.\"".\nUtterance #12.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Contextual Reading**: The target utterance is ""Even worse, if your friend that has finished a game invites you to play it, you go in with the understanding that they are replaying it."" This is a continuation of a discussion about why some players might feel discouraged when playing games with others who have progressed further. The previous messages by AurelianoTampa suggest that friends might feel less engaged if they know someone else has already experienced the game.

2. **Speaker's Intent**: The primary communicative intent of the speaker, wyldmage, seems to be to elaborate on the situation described by AurelianoTampa. Wyldmage is adding a perspective that when a person who has finished a game invites others to play, there's an inherent understanding that the inviter is replaying the game, which could affect the dynamics and enjoyment of the others.

3. **Plausible Act Options**:  
   - **Elaborate**: Wyldmage is expanding on the previous point about how prior experience with a game can impact group dynamics.  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about a common understanding or expectation in gaming contexts.  
   - **Claim**: It could be seen as wyldmage's subjective assertion about the social dynamics of gaming.  

4. **Choosing the Primary Act**: The utterance is primarily serving to elaborate on the previous comments by providing additional context and explanation. It fits well under ""Elaborate"" because it's building on the previous discussion about gaming experiences and expectations.

5. **Politeness/Impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is neutral in tone.

6. **Meta-Acts**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a straightforward elaboration.

Given the context and the content, ""Elaborate"" is the most fitting act.

This is a response to AurelianoTampa's comments, which suggest that the friends wanted a shared new experience, but OP's prior solo playthrough might have diminished their enjoyment.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is providing an explanation or perspective on why OP's friends might have felt discouraged. The utterance seems to clarify or add to AurelianoTampa's points about the group dynamic and expectations.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the sequence of events (OP invited them, then played solo).
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance builds on or clarifies the previous discussion about why the friends might have felt invalidated.
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be asserting an opinion about the situation, but the focus here seems more on providing context.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no strong indication of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral explanation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm here. The utterance appears to be straightforward.

Given the context and the communicative intent, the primary act is **Inform**, as wyldmage is providing information about OP's actions to explain the situation further.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #13.0 from wyldmage:\n\""But OP invited them without having played the game, then after they started, played through the entire thing solo.\""\nThe full message is:\nBut OP invited them without having played the game, then after they started, played through the entire thing solo.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""But OP invited them without having played the game, then after they started, played through the entire thing solo.\"".\nUtterance #13.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""But OP invited them without having played the game, then after they started, played through the entire thing solo."" This is a response to AurelianoTampa's comments, which suggest that the friends wanted a shared new experience, but OP's prior solo playthrough might have diminished their enjoyment.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is providing an explanation or perspective on why OP's friends might have felt discouraged. The utterance seems to clarify or add to AurelianoTampa's points about the group dynamic and expectations.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the sequence of events (OP invited them, then played solo).
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance builds on or clarifies the previous discussion about why the friends might have felt invalidated.
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be asserting an opinion about the situation, but the focus here seems more on providing context.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no strong indication of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral explanation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm here. The utterance appears to be straightforward.

Given the context and the communicative intent, the primary act is **Inform**, as wyldmage is providing information about OP's actions to explain the situation further.

14.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,And this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it. ,AurelianoTampa,Reply,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""And this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it."" is part of a response to the original post by CallSign_Fjor. The post describes a situation where the user progressed further in games than their friends, leading to their friends losing interest. The surrounding context includes comments by AurelianoTampa that suggest the friends wanted to experience the game together without feeling overshadowed.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it"" indicates that wyldmage is making a subjective observation or speculation about the situation. The phrase suggests that the speaker believes this behavior by OP (progressing further ahead in games) is a repeated pattern. The key here is the speculative nature of ""sounds like,"" which implies an opinion or inference rather than a factual statement.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion or speculation based on the information provided by OP. The use of ""sounds like"" makes it clear that this is an opinion rather than a statement of fact.
   - **Inform**: This act is less likely because the utterance does not provide factual information that is verifiable; it is more about the speaker's interpretation.
   - **Reject**: This act does not apply as the speaker is not disagreeing or disputing any previous point directly.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The statement is neutral and does not contain any elements that would enhance or attack the addressee's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance. The statement is a straightforward speculative claim.

Based on the analysis, the primary communicative act is **Claim**, with no politeness or meta-act markers evident.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #14.0 from wyldmage:\n\""And this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it.\""\nThe full message is:\nAnd this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""And this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it."" is part of a response to the original post by CallSign_Fjor. The post describes a situation where the user progressed further in games than their friends, leading to their friends losing interest. The surrounding context includes comments by AurelianoTampa that suggest the friends wanted to experience the game together without feeling overshadowed.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""this sounds like it isn't OP's first time doing it"" indicates that wyldmage is making a subjective observation or speculation about the situation. The phrase suggests that the speaker believes this behavior by OP (progressing further ahead in games) is a repeated pattern. The key here is the speculative nature of ""sounds like,"" which implies an opinion or inference rather than a factual statement.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion or speculation based on the information provided by OP. The use of ""sounds like"" makes it clear that this is an opinion rather than a statement of fact.
   - **Inform**: This act is less likely because the utterance does not provide factual information that is verifiable; it is more about the speaker's interpretation.
   - **Reject**: This act does not apply as the speaker is not disagreeing or disputing any previous point directly.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The statement is neutral and does not contain any elements that would enhance or attack the addressee's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance. The statement is a straightforward speculative claim.

Based on the analysis, the primary communicative act is **Claim**, with no politeness or meta-act markers evident.

14.0,2.0,,,wyldmage,,But it may be the last time his friends bother including him when they play a game together - ,AurelianoTampa,,Desire (Irrealis),,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""But it may be the last time his friends bother including him when they play a game together -"" is a part of a response to a discussion on why OP's friends might have lost interest in playing games with them. The context suggests that OP has a habit of progressing faster than their friends, which might deter them from playing together.  
   
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the speaker (wyldmage) seems to be to speculate or predict a consequence of OP's behavior. They are suggesting that if OP continues their current approach, it might lead to their friends excluding them from future games.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Desire (Irrealis)**: This act involves speculation or prediction about a future event that may or may not happen. The phrase ""it may be the last time"" indicates a prediction about the future.  
   - **Claim**: This involves making an assertion or opinion. However, the use of ""may"" suggests a hypothetical situation rather than a firm assertion.  
   
   Between these, ""Desire (Irrealis)"" is more fitting as the utterance is speculative in nature, predicting a potential outcome based on current circumstances.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral prediction without any explicit face-threatening or face-enhancing elements.  

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in this utterance.  

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate communicative act is ""Desire (Irrealis)"" with no politeness or meta-act annotations.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""But it may be the last time his friends bother including him when they play a game together -"" is a part of a response to a discussion on why OP's friends might have lost interest in playing games with them. The context suggests that OP has a habit of progressing faster than their friends, which might deter them from playing together.  
   
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of the speaker (wyldmage) seems to be to speculate or predict a consequence of OP's behavior. They are suggesting that if OP continues their current approach, it might lead to their friends excluding them from future games.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Desire (Irrealis)**: This act involves speculation or prediction about a future event that may or may not happen. The phrase ""it may be the last time"" indicates a prediction about the future.  
   - **Claim**: This involves making an assertion or opinion. However, the use of ""may"" suggests a hypothetical situation rather than a firm assertion.  
   
   Between these, ""Desire (Irrealis)"" is more fitting as the utterance is speculative in nature, predicting a potential outcome based on current circumstances.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral prediction without any explicit face-threatening or face-enhancing elements.  

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in this utterance.  

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate communicative act is ""Desire (Irrealis)"" with no politeness or meta-act annotations.

15.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,because he's demonstrating a repeated inability to only play the game when they're also playing.,AurelianoTampa,Reply,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""because he's demonstrating a repeated inability to only play the game when they're also playing"" is a response to a discussion about why the original poster's friends might feel discouraged from playing games with them. The preceding context from AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together and felt less inclined to play after the original poster had already progressed on their own.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is providing an explanation for why the original poster's friends might have felt discouraged. The intent seems to be to offer an analysis or reason for the friends' behavior, which aligns with the context of explaining or justifying a situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. While the utterance does offer a reason, it is not a factual statement that can be verified, but rather an interpretation or explanation.
   - **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion or opinion. The speaker is speculating about the reason behind the friends' behavior, which is subjective and not verifiable. This fits the definition of a claim.
   - **Elaborate**: This act involves commenting on or explaining a previous utterance. The speaker is elaborating on the possible motivations behind the friends' actions, but it is not a direct elaboration of their own previous utterance.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward explanation without any hedging, compliments, or attacks.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication that this is reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance appears to be sincere and direct.

The most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim"" because it is a subjective interpretation of the situation, offering an opinion on why the friends might have acted as they did.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #15.0 from wyldmage:\n\""because he's demonstrating a repeated inability to only play the game when they're also playing.\""\nThe full message is:\nbecause he's demonstrating a repeated inability to only play the game when they're also playing.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""because he's demonstrating a repeated inability to only play the game when they're also playing.\"".\nUtterance #15.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""because he's demonstrating a repeated inability to only play the game when they're also playing"" is a response to a discussion about why the original poster's friends might feel discouraged from playing games with them. The preceding context from AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together and felt less inclined to play after the original poster had already progressed on their own.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is providing an explanation for why the original poster's friends might have felt discouraged. The intent seems to be to offer an analysis or reason for the friends' behavior, which aligns with the context of explaining or justifying a situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. While the utterance does offer a reason, it is not a factual statement that can be verified, but rather an interpretation or explanation.
   - **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion or opinion. The speaker is speculating about the reason behind the friends' behavior, which is subjective and not verifiable. This fits the definition of a claim.
   - **Elaborate**: This act involves commenting on or explaining a previous utterance. The speaker is elaborating on the possible motivations behind the friends' actions, but it is not a direct elaboration of their own previous utterance.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward explanation without any hedging, compliments, or attacks.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication that this is reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance appears to be sincere and direct.

The most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim"" because it is a subjective interpretation of the situation, offering an opinion on why the friends might have acted as they did.

If you start a new game with your friends, start a DIFFERENT game solo, so when you get an itch to play something, you go through it.",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Direct,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance by wyldmage is a response to the original post by CallSign_Fjor, who is discussing their friends' reaction to their faster progression in games. The context suggests that CallSign_Fjor is seeking advice or understanding about why their friends might feel invalidated by their actions.  
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of wyldmage's utterance is to offer a suggestion or advice to CallSign_Fjor. The speaker is recommending a strategy to balance playing games with friends and alone to avoid the issue described.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Direct**: The speaker is advising CallSign_Fjor to learn to play more than one game at once and to start a different game solo when they have an itch to play. This could be seen as a directive, as the speaker is telling CallSign_Fjor what they should do.  
   - **Invite**: The suggestion could also be seen as an invitation to try a new approach to gaming, but the language used (""I recommend"") leans more towards advice or direction rather than a mere suggestion.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance is polite and offers constructive advice without imposing or criticizing. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness beyond the standard polite tone of giving advice.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The speaker's intent is sincere and straightforward.  

Considering the above analysis, the most appropriate act for this utterance is ""Direct"" as the speaker is advising CallSign_Fjor on what to do in the future.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance by wyldmage is a response to the original post by CallSign_Fjor, who is discussing their friends' reaction to their faster progression in games. The context suggests that CallSign_Fjor is seeking advice or understanding about why their friends might feel invalidated by their actions.  
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of wyldmage's utterance is to offer a suggestion or advice to CallSign_Fjor. The speaker is recommending a strategy to balance playing games with friends and alone to avoid the issue described.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Direct**: The speaker is advising CallSign_Fjor to learn to play more than one game at once and to start a different game solo when they have an itch to play. This could be seen as a directive, as the speaker is telling CallSign_Fjor what they should do.  
   - **Invite**: The suggestion could also be seen as an invitation to try a new approach to gaming, but the language used (""I recommend"") leans more towards advice or direction rather than a mere suggestion.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance is polite and offers constructive advice without imposing or criticizing. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness beyond the standard polite tone of giving advice.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The speaker's intent is sincere and straightforward.  

Considering the above analysis, the most appropriate act for this utterance is ""Direct"" as the speaker is advising CallSign_Fjor on what to do in the future.

17.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,"Your natural drive & curiosity lead to you wanting to finish a game binge-style, while your friends are different. ",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Claim,,,"1. **Contextual Analysis**: The utterance ""Your natural drive & curiosity lead to you wanting to finish a game binge-style, while your friends are different."" is a response to a discussion about differing playstyles and the impact of one player's progression on their friends' gaming experience. The surrounding context includes comments about how one player's advanced progression can demotivate others, as described by AurelianoTampa.

2. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, seems to be providing an explanation or interpretation of the situation. They are attributing the original poster's behavior to their personal traits (""natural drive & curiosity"") and contrasting it with the friends' different approach. This suggests an attempt to clarify the differing motivations and perspectives in the situation.

3. **Act Options Considered**: 
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the poster's traits and behaviors, potentially verifiable if one knows the person well.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be seen as an assertion or opinion about the poster's motivations, which are subjective and not directly verifiable.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be an elaboration on the original post's topic, providing additional context or interpretation.

4. **Primary Communicative Act**: The most fitting act is **Claim**. The statement reflects an opinion about why the original poster behaves as they do, focusing on subjective motivations that are not verifiable.

5. **Politeness Evaluation**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed. The tone is neutral and explanatory.

6. **Meta-Act Consideration**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony. The utterance appears sincere and straightforward.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Contextual Analysis**: The utterance ""Your natural drive & curiosity lead to you wanting to finish a game binge-style, while your friends are different."" is a response to a discussion about differing playstyles and the impact of one player's progression on their friends' gaming experience. The surrounding context includes comments about how one player's advanced progression can demotivate others, as described by AurelianoTampa.

2. **Speaker's Intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, seems to be providing an explanation or interpretation of the situation. They are attributing the original poster's behavior to their personal traits (""natural drive & curiosity"") and contrasting it with the friends' different approach. This suggests an attempt to clarify the differing motivations and perspectives in the situation.

3. **Act Options Considered**: 
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the poster's traits and behaviors, potentially verifiable if one knows the person well.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be seen as an assertion or opinion about the poster's motivations, which are subjective and not directly verifiable.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be an elaboration on the original post's topic, providing additional context or interpretation.

4. **Primary Communicative Act**: The most fitting act is **Claim**. The statement reflects an opinion about why the original poster behaves as they do, focusing on subjective motivations that are not verifiable.

5. **Politeness Evaluation**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed. The tone is neutral and explanatory.

6. **Meta-Act Consideration**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony. The utterance appears sincere and straightforward.

18.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,"You're going to have to choose between playing with friends, and playing at your own pace.",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Direct,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You're going to have to choose between playing with friends, and playing at your own pace."" is a response in a thread where the original poster is expressing frustration about friends losing interest in playing games together due to differences in progression pace. The context includes a discussion about how progressing faster than friends can impact group gaming experiences.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is providing advice or guidance to the original poster. The phrase ""You're going to have to choose"" suggests that the original poster needs to make a decision, implying a course of action.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Direct**: This act involves commanding, advising, or requiring someone to do something. The phrase ""You're going to have to choose"" fits with advising the original poster to make a decision between two options.
   - **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. The statement could be seen as informing the original poster of a reality they may not have considered.
   - **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. The utterance could be interpreted as expressing an opinion about the necessity of making a choice.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance is neutral in terms of politeness. It does not contain any positive or negative politeness strategies, nor does it attack or impose on the addressee's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is straightforward and does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements like sarcasm.

The most fitting act is **Direct**, as the speaker is advising the original poster to make a choice. The other options, Inform and Claim, are less appropriate because the primary intent is to guide the original poster towards a decision rather than merely stating a fact or opinion.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You're going to have to choose between playing with friends, and playing at your own pace."" is a response in a thread where the original poster is expressing frustration about friends losing interest in playing games together due to differences in progression pace. The context includes a discussion about how progressing faster than friends can impact group gaming experiences.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is providing advice or guidance to the original poster. The phrase ""You're going to have to choose"" suggests that the original poster needs to make a decision, implying a course of action.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Direct**: This act involves commanding, advising, or requiring someone to do something. The phrase ""You're going to have to choose"" fits with advising the original poster to make a decision between two options.
   - **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. The statement could be seen as informing the original poster of a reality they may not have considered.
   - **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. The utterance could be interpreted as expressing an opinion about the necessity of making a choice.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance is neutral in terms of politeness. It does not contain any positive or negative politeness strategies, nor does it attack or impose on the addressee's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is straightforward and does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements like sarcasm.

The most fitting act is **Direct**, as the speaker is advising the original poster to make a choice. The other options, Inform and Claim, are less appropriate because the primary intent is to guide the original poster towards a decision rather than merely stating a fact or opinion.

",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They aren't mad that you've already beaten the game. They're mad that you started the game with them, then finished it without them."" It is a response to AurelianoTampa, who was suggesting that the original poster's friends might have been upset because they wanted to experience the game together, and the original poster's actions might have taken away from that experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of wyldmage's utterance is to provide an explanation or clarification about why the original poster's friends might be upset. The speaker is attempting to offer insight into the friends' perspective by contrasting two reasons for their feelings.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the emotional state of the friends and the reason behind it. This is the most fitting category as the speaker is conveying what they believe to be the truth about the situation.
   - **Elaborate**: While the speaker is building upon AurelianoTampa's previous message, the primary purpose is to inform rather than to elaborate on their own previous utterance.
   - **Claim**: Although the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the friends' feelings, the context suggests that it is more about informing the original poster based on the situation rather than speculating.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral explanation.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is not reported speech and does not appear to be sarcastic or non-bona fide. It is a straightforward explanation.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing an explanation intended to convey understanding of the friends' perspective.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They aren't mad that you've already beaten the game. They're mad that you started the game with them, then finished it without them."" It is a response to AurelianoTampa, who was suggesting that the original poster's friends might have been upset because they wanted to experience the game together, and the original poster's actions might have taken away from that experience.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of wyldmage's utterance is to provide an explanation or clarification about why the original poster's friends might be upset. The speaker is attempting to offer insight into the friends' perspective by contrasting two reasons for their feelings.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the emotional state of the friends and the reason behind it. This is the most fitting category as the speaker is conveying what they believe to be the truth about the situation.
   - **Elaborate**: While the speaker is building upon AurelianoTampa's previous message, the primary purpose is to inform rather than to elaborate on their own previous utterance.
   - **Claim**: Although the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the friends' feelings, the context suggests that it is more about informing the original poster based on the situation rather than speculating.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral explanation.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is not reported speech and does not appear to be sarcastic or non-bona fide. It is a straightforward explanation.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing an explanation intended to convey understanding of the friends' perspective.

",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""Even if you're still willing to play with them, it's not the same."" This is a response to a discussion about why friends might not want to continue playing a game with someone who has progressed further. The previous comments, especially from AurelianoTampa, suggest that the friends wanted a shared experience and felt that the user's solo progression disrupted that.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is likely trying to explain or provide insight into why the original poster's friends might have lost interest in playing together. The statement acknowledges the original poster's willingness to play with their friends but points out that the experience has changed.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Claim**: The utterance expresses an opinion or belief about the situation, indicating that the experience isn't the same even if the original poster is willing to play.
   - **Inform**: It could be seen as providing information about the nature of shared gaming experiences and how they change when one person has progressed further.
   - **Elaborate**: It builds on AurelianoTampa's earlier comments, further explaining why the situation might feel different to the friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement without any markers of politeness strategies or impoliteness.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There are no meta-acts such as reported speech or non-bona fide communication in the utterance. It is a sincere expression.

Considering the context and the primary communicative intent, the utterance is best categorized as a **Claim** because it is expressing a subjective belief about the situation and the nature of shared gaming experiences.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #20.0 from wyldmage:\n\""Even if you're still willing to play with them, it's not the same.\""\nThe full message is:\nEven if you're still willing to play with them, it's not the same.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""Even if you're still willing to play with them, it's not the same.\"".\nUtterance #20.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""Even if you're still willing to play with them, it's not the same."" This is a response to a discussion about why friends might not want to continue playing a game with someone who has progressed further. The previous comments, especially from AurelianoTampa, suggest that the friends wanted a shared experience and felt that the user's solo progression disrupted that.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, is likely trying to explain or provide insight into why the original poster's friends might have lost interest in playing together. The statement acknowledges the original poster's willingness to play with their friends but points out that the experience has changed.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Claim**: The utterance expresses an opinion or belief about the situation, indicating that the experience isn't the same even if the original poster is willing to play.
   - **Inform**: It could be seen as providing information about the nature of shared gaming experiences and how they change when one person has progressed further.
   - **Elaborate**: It builds on AurelianoTampa's earlier comments, further explaining why the situation might feel different to the friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement without any markers of politeness strategies or impoliteness.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There are no meta-acts such as reported speech or non-bona fide communication in the utterance. It is a sincere expression.

Considering the context and the primary communicative intent, the utterance is best categorized as a **Claim** because it is expressing a subjective belief about the situation and the nature of shared gaming experiences.

21.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,"And to make matters worse, you're taking stuff you earned without them, and using it to ""rush"" them through the game. You're not letting them enjoy it at their own pace. ",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Reject,-P,non-bona fide,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user wyldmage is responding to the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, who is questioning why their friends seem discouraged by their faster progression in games. Wyldmage is providing a perspective on why the friends might feel invalidated.  
   
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The intent of wyldmage's utterance is to explain and critique the original poster's actions. They are pointing out that CallSign_Fjor's actions might be perceived as rushing the friends through the game, which could be seen as inconsiderate of their desire to enjoy the game at their own pace.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Reject**: Wyldmage is disagreeing with the original poster's understanding of the situation, suggesting that the actions taken are not appropriate and are contributing to the problem.  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the consequences of the original poster's actions, explaining how these actions might affect the friends' experience.  
   - **Direct**: There's an implicit directive for the original poster to change their behavior by pointing out the negative impact of their actions, though this is more indirect.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The tone of the message is critical and points out a flaw in the original poster's actions. It lacks positive politeness as it does not affirm the original poster's perspective. It could be seen as a violation of positive politeness because it challenges and criticizes the original poster's actions, potentially attacking their positive face by suggesting they are inconsiderate. However, it is not overtly rude or insulting.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The use of quotes around ""rush"" suggests a non-bona fide element, indicating that the term is not being used in its literal sense but rather to convey a specific criticism of the behavior.  

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate act is **Reject** due to the disagreement and critique of the original poster's actions. The politeness value could be considered as a violation of positive politeness due to the critical nature of the comment. The use of quotes around ""rush"" indicates a non-bona fide usage, adding emphasis to the criticism.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user wyldmage is responding to the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, who is questioning why their friends seem discouraged by their faster progression in games. Wyldmage is providing a perspective on why the friends might feel invalidated.  
   
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The intent of wyldmage's utterance is to explain and critique the original poster's actions. They are pointing out that CallSign_Fjor's actions might be perceived as rushing the friends through the game, which could be seen as inconsiderate of their desire to enjoy the game at their own pace.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Reject**: Wyldmage is disagreeing with the original poster's understanding of the situation, suggesting that the actions taken are not appropriate and are contributing to the problem.  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information about the consequences of the original poster's actions, explaining how these actions might affect the friends' experience.  
   - **Direct**: There's an implicit directive for the original poster to change their behavior by pointing out the negative impact of their actions, though this is more indirect.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The tone of the message is critical and points out a flaw in the original poster's actions. It lacks positive politeness as it does not affirm the original poster's perspective. It could be seen as a violation of positive politeness because it challenges and criticizes the original poster's actions, potentially attacking their positive face by suggesting they are inconsiderate. However, it is not overtly rude or insulting.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The use of quotes around ""rush"" suggests a non-bona fide element, indicating that the term is not being used in its literal sense but rather to convey a specific criticism of the behavior.  

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate act is **Reject** due to the disagreement and critique of the original poster's actions. The politeness value could be considered as a violation of positive politeness due to the critical nature of the comment. The use of quotes around ""rush"" indicates a non-bona fide usage, adding emphasis to the criticism.

The user wyldmage is pointing out that CallSign_Fjor did not disclose their use of resources from their solo game progression to summon bosses until someone else in the group mentioned it.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of wyldmage seems to be to criticize or challenge CallSign_Fjor's actions and decisions regarding their gameplay with friends. The phrasing ""you didn't even admit"" suggests an accusation of hiding information or being dishonest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Reject**: This act involves disagreement or disputing someone else's statement or actions. Here, wyldmage is essentially disagreeing with CallSign_Fjor's approach to playing the game with friends.
   - **Repair**: This act could involve seeking clarification or correcting a misunderstanding. However, wyldmage is not seeking clarification but rather pointing out what they perceive as a misstep.
   - **Inform**: Providing factual information. However, the statement is more of a criticism than a neutral presentation of facts.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone of the utterance is critical and confrontational, suggesting a violation of positive politeness. The use of ""Hell"" and the accusatory tone indicate a lack of respect for CallSign_Fjor's positive face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm in this utterance. The statement is direct and sincere in its criticism.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting act is ""Reject"" due to the critical and confrontational nature of the statement, and there is an impoliteness aspect, specifically -P [Insult], because of the accusatory and disrespectful tone.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #21.0 from wyldmage:\n\""Hell, you didn't even admit that you were using \""I beat the game and farmed\"" resources to summon bosses for them until they SAID SOMETHING about it.\""\nThe full message is:\nAnd to make matters worse, you're taking stuff you earned without them, and using it to \""rush\"" them through the game.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is a part of a critical response to the original poster, CallSign_Fjor. The user wyldmage is pointing out that CallSign_Fjor did not disclose their use of resources from their solo game progression to summon bosses until someone else in the group mentioned it.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of wyldmage seems to be to criticize or challenge CallSign_Fjor's actions and decisions regarding their gameplay with friends. The phrasing ""you didn't even admit"" suggests an accusation of hiding information or being dishonest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Reject**: This act involves disagreement or disputing someone else's statement or actions. Here, wyldmage is essentially disagreeing with CallSign_Fjor's approach to playing the game with friends.
   - **Repair**: This act could involve seeking clarification or correcting a misunderstanding. However, wyldmage is not seeking clarification but rather pointing out what they perceive as a misstep.
   - **Inform**: Providing factual information. However, the statement is more of a criticism than a neutral presentation of facts.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone of the utterance is critical and confrontational, suggesting a violation of positive politeness. The use of ""Hell"" and the accusatory tone indicate a lack of respect for CallSign_Fjor's positive face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm in this utterance. The statement is direct and sincere in its criticism.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting act is ""Reject"" due to the critical and confrontational nature of the statement, and there is an impoliteness aspect, specifically -P [Insult], because of the accusatory and disrespectful tone.

22.0,1.0,250127.0,,wyldmage,,You've shattered trust with them.,AurelianoTampa,Reply,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You've shattered trust with them."" is a direct response to the ongoing discussion about why some friends might have lost interest in playing games together when one person progresses faster than the others. The context indicates a discussion about the dynamics of playing games collaboratively and the impact of one player advancing too quickly.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, seems to be providing an explanation or an analysis of the situation. The intent is to inform the original poster about a possible reason why their friends are no longer interested in playing together. The phrase suggests that the original poster's actions have led to a breach of trust with their friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is informing the original poster about a possible consequence of their actions, which is the loss of trust. This act is about providing factual information or an analysis that is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be making a subjective assertion about the situation, which is unverifiable in principle as it pertains to the internal feelings of the friends.
   - **Reject**: The speaker might be rejecting the original poster's perspective by offering a contrasting viewpoint, but this seems less likely as the primary act because the focus is more on explaining rather than disagreeing.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any explicit markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward statement without any hedging or face-threatening language.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or any non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. It is a direct statement meant to convey information or an opinion.

Considering the above points, the most fitting act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing an analysis or explanation of the situation to the original poster. There are no clear markers of politeness or impoliteness, and no meta-acts are present.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You've shattered trust with them."" is a direct response to the ongoing discussion about why some friends might have lost interest in playing games together when one person progresses faster than the others. The context indicates a discussion about the dynamics of playing games collaboratively and the impact of one player advancing too quickly.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, wyldmage, seems to be providing an explanation or an analysis of the situation. The intent is to inform the original poster about a possible reason why their friends are no longer interested in playing together. The phrase suggests that the original poster's actions have led to a breach of trust with their friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is informing the original poster about a possible consequence of their actions, which is the loss of trust. This act is about providing factual information or an analysis that is verifiable in principle.
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be making a subjective assertion about the situation, which is unverifiable in principle as it pertains to the internal feelings of the friends.
   - **Reject**: The speaker might be rejecting the original poster's perspective by offering a contrasting viewpoint, but this seems less likely as the primary act because the focus is more on explaining rather than disagreeing.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any explicit markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward statement without any hedging or face-threatening language.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or any non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. It is a direct statement meant to convey information or an opinion.

Considering the above points, the most fitting act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing an analysis or explanation of the situation to the original poster. There are no clear markers of politeness or impoliteness, and no meta-acts are present.

This is a response to a discussion about why friends might be discouraged from playing if someone progresses faster in a game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent seems to be to offer an explanation or hypothesis as to why the friends might feel invalidated or discouraged. The speaker suggests that there might be a suspicion or concern that the original poster is progressing secretly and then trying to rush the friends to catch up.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making an assertion based on their interpretation of the situation, suggesting a possible reason for the friends' behavior.
   - **Inform**: The speaker could be seen as providing information about a potential mindset or concern of the friends.
   - **Elaborate**: This could be seen as an elaboration on the idea previously mentioned by AurelianoTampa about how the original poster's actions might affect the group's dynamic.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral observation or hypothesis about the situation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The phrase ""hurry them up"" is in quotes, which may indicate a non-bona fide element, such as sarcasm or a hypothetical scenario. However, it doesn't seem to affect the primary communicative act, which remains a claim or speculation.

Given the analysis, the primary act is ""Claim"" as the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the friends' possible thoughts and feelings.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #23.0 from wyldmage:\n\""They'll never know for sure whether you're secretly farming all night just so that you can \""hurry them up\"" towards the endgame you've already done.\""\nThe full message is:\nThey'll never know for sure whether you're secretly farming all night just so that you can \""hurry them up\"" towards the endgame you've already done.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""They'll never know for sure whether you're secretly farming all night just so that you can \""hurry them up\"" towards the endgame you've already done.\"".\nUtterance #23.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance by wyldmage is ""They'll never know for sure whether you're secretly farming all night just so that you can ""hurry them up"" towards the endgame you've already done."" This is a response to a discussion about why friends might be discouraged from playing if someone progresses faster in a game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent seems to be to offer an explanation or hypothesis as to why the friends might feel invalidated or discouraged. The speaker suggests that there might be a suspicion or concern that the original poster is progressing secretly and then trying to rush the friends to catch up.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making an assertion based on their interpretation of the situation, suggesting a possible reason for the friends' behavior.
   - **Inform**: The speaker could be seen as providing information about a potential mindset or concern of the friends.
   - **Elaborate**: This could be seen as an elaboration on the idea previously mentioned by AurelianoTampa about how the original poster's actions might affect the group's dynamic.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral observation or hypothesis about the situation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The phrase ""hurry them up"" is in quotes, which may indicate a non-bona fide element, such as sarcasm or a hypothetical scenario. However, it doesn't seem to affect the primary communicative act, which remains a claim or speculation.

Given the analysis, the primary act is ""Claim"" as the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the friends' possible thoughts and feelings.

24.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,"I get that, ",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Accept,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""I get that,"" is a response by CallSign_Fjor to AurelianoTampa's explanation about why CallSign_Fjor's friends might not want to play the game anymore. AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together, and CallSign_Fjor's prior experience might have diminished the novelty for them.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""I get that"" suggests that CallSign_Fjor is expressing understanding or acknowledgment of AurelianoTampa's explanation. This is an act of acceptance, as CallSign_Fjor is showing agreement or concurrence with the perspective provided by AurelianoTampa.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Accept**: CallSign_Fjor is acknowledging and agreeing with the explanation provided by AurelianoTampa.
   - **React**: While there is a component of reacting to the explanation, the primary function is accepting the explanation rather than simply reacting with an emotional response.
   - **Claim**: Not applicable here as CallSign_Fjor is not making a subjective assertion about their own beliefs or feelings.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not carry a clear politeness or impoliteness value. It is a neutral acknowledgment of understanding.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There are no indications of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance. The statement appears to be sincere.

Given these considerations, the primary communicative act is ""Accept,"" as CallSign_Fjor is acknowledging and agreeing with the perspective shared by AurelianoTampa. There is no politeness or meta-act applicable in this context.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #24.0 from CallSign_Fjor:\n\""I get that,\""\nThe full message is:\nI get that,\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""I get that,\"".\nUtterance #24.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""I get that,"" is a response by CallSign_Fjor to AurelianoTampa's explanation about why CallSign_Fjor's friends might not want to play the game anymore. AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together, and CallSign_Fjor's prior experience might have diminished the novelty for them.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""I get that"" suggests that CallSign_Fjor is expressing understanding or acknowledgment of AurelianoTampa's explanation. This is an act of acceptance, as CallSign_Fjor is showing agreement or concurrence with the perspective provided by AurelianoTampa.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Accept**: CallSign_Fjor is acknowledging and agreeing with the explanation provided by AurelianoTampa.
   - **React**: While there is a component of reacting to the explanation, the primary function is accepting the explanation rather than simply reacting with an emotional response.
   - **Claim**: Not applicable here as CallSign_Fjor is not making a subjective assertion about their own beliefs or feelings.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not carry a clear politeness or impoliteness value. It is a neutral acknowledgment of understanding.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There are no indications of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm in this utterance. The statement appears to be sincere.

Given these considerations, the primary communicative act is ""Accept,"" as CallSign_Fjor is acknowledging and agreeing with the perspective shared by AurelianoTampa. There is no politeness or meta-act applicable in this context.

I was still playing alongside them in downgraded gear.",AurelianoTampa,Reply,Elaborate,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""but i wasn't like 'Yeah the next episode will be awesome.' I was still playing alongside them in downgraded gear."" is a response to AurelianoTampa's suggestion that CallSign_Fjor's friends may have felt like they were being babysat because CallSign_Fjor had already experienced the game content. AurelianoTampa likened it to watching a show with someone who has already seen it and spoils the surprise.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, seems to be clarifying their behavior and countering the implication that they were spoiling the experience for their friends by having already progressed in the game. The intent is to explain that they were not behaving in a way that would ruin the experience for others.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is expanding on their previous actions by explaining how they behaved (or did not behave) while playing with their friends. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast to the scenario presented by AurelianoTampa, indicating elaboration on their previous message.
   - **Repair**: The speaker might be clarifying a potential misunderstanding about their behavior, although the primary focus seems more on elaborating rather than directly correcting a misunderstanding.
   - **Claim**: The speaker asserts their actions and intentions, but the focus seems more on explaining and expanding rather than simply asserting.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral explanation of behavior.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The phrase ""Yeah the next episode will be awesome"" is a hypothetical reported speech, representing what CallSign_Fjor did not say. This is a form of indirect speech meant to illustrate a point.

Based on the above analysis, the primary act is **Elaborate** because the speaker is providing additional information to clarify their previous actions and intentions. The meta-act of **reported** applies because of the indirect hypothetical speech used to illustrate what they did not do.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #25.0 from CallSign_Fjor:\n\""but i wasn't like \""Yeah the next episode will be awesome.\"" I was still playing alongside them in downgraded gear.\""\nThe full message is:\nbut i wasn't like \""Yeah the next episode will be awesome.\"" I was still playing alongside them in downgraded gear.\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""but i wasn't like \""Yeah the next episode will be awesome.\"" I was still playing alongside them in downgraded gear.\"".\nUtterance #25.0 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""but i wasn't like 'Yeah the next episode will be awesome.' I was still playing alongside them in downgraded gear."" is a response to AurelianoTampa's suggestion that CallSign_Fjor's friends may have felt like they were being babysat because CallSign_Fjor had already experienced the game content. AurelianoTampa likened it to watching a show with someone who has already seen it and spoils the surprise.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, seems to be clarifying their behavior and countering the implication that they were spoiling the experience for their friends by having already progressed in the game. The intent is to explain that they were not behaving in a way that would ruin the experience for others.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is expanding on their previous actions by explaining how they behaved (or did not behave) while playing with their friends. The use of ""but"" suggests a contrast to the scenario presented by AurelianoTampa, indicating elaboration on their previous message.
   - **Repair**: The speaker might be clarifying a potential misunderstanding about their behavior, although the primary focus seems more on elaborating rather than directly correcting a misunderstanding.
   - **Claim**: The speaker asserts their actions and intentions, but the focus seems more on explaining and expanding rather than simply asserting.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral explanation of behavior.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The phrase ""Yeah the next episode will be awesome"" is a hypothetical reported speech, representing what CallSign_Fjor did not say. This is a form of indirect speech meant to illustrate a point.

Based on the above analysis, the primary act is **Elaborate** because the speaker is providing additional information to clarify their previous actions and intentions. The meta-act of **reported** applies because of the indirect hypothetical speech used to illustrate what they did not do.

26.0,1.0,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,I'm not sure what kind of response you're looking for here. ,CallSign_Fjor,Reply,Repair,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""I'm not sure what kind of response you're looking for here."" is a reply to a post by CallSign_Fjor, who is expressing frustration and confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing games after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the games.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to be expressing uncertainty or confusion about how to respond to CallSign_Fjor's situation. This could indicate a request for clarification on what CallSign_Fjor expects from the discussion.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The speaker might be seeking information about what kind of response or solution CallSign_Fjor is expecting. However, the phrasing suggests more of a statement than a direct question.
   - **Repair**: The speaker might be indicating a need for clarification regarding CallSign_Fjor's expectations from the community or from the discussion. This is plausible because the speaker is expressing uncertainty about the appropriate response.
   - **React**: The speaker might simply be expressing a reaction of confusion or puzzlement regarding the situation described by CallSign_Fjor.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It appears neutral and straightforward.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There are no indications of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony in this utterance.

Given the analysis, the primary communicative act is **Repair**, as the speaker is indicating a need for clarification about what response is expected.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""I'm not sure what kind of response you're looking for here."" is a reply to a post by CallSign_Fjor, who is expressing frustration and confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing games after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in the games.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to be expressing uncertainty or confusion about how to respond to CallSign_Fjor's situation. This could indicate a request for clarification on what CallSign_Fjor expects from the discussion.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The speaker might be seeking information about what kind of response or solution CallSign_Fjor is expecting. However, the phrasing suggests more of a statement than a direct question.
   - **Repair**: The speaker might be indicating a need for clarification regarding CallSign_Fjor's expectations from the community or from the discussion. This is plausible because the speaker is expressing uncertainty about the appropriate response.
   - **React**: The speaker might simply be expressing a reaction of confusion or puzzlement regarding the situation described by CallSign_Fjor.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It appears neutral and straightforward.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There are no indications of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony in this utterance.

Given the analysis, the primary communicative act is **Repair**, as the speaker is indicating a need for clarification about what response is expected.

It is a reply to CallSign_Fjor, who is puzzled about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them after they advanced further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is pointing out to CallSign_Fjor that their friends have already expressed their reasons for not wanting to play anymore. The intent seems to be to inform or remind CallSign_Fjor of the reasons given by their friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information that can be verified by CallSign_Fjor based on their past interactions with their friends.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker could be seen as elaborating on the reason given by the friends by providing a more explicit statement of their reasoning.
   - **React**: It could also be a reaction to CallSign_Fjor's confusion about their friends' behavior.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement without any additional emotional or evaluative content.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a direct statement based on the context provided by CallSign_Fjor.

After considering these options, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" because the speaker is providing factual information about the reason for the friends' behavior.

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""Your friends told you why they don't want to play now - you already beat the game."" It is a reply to CallSign_Fjor, who is puzzled about why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them after they advanced further in the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is pointing out to CallSign_Fjor that their friends have already expressed their reasons for not wanting to play anymore. The intent seems to be to inform or remind CallSign_Fjor of the reasons given by their friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information that can be verified by CallSign_Fjor based on their past interactions with their friends.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker could be seen as elaborating on the reason given by the friends by providing a more explicit statement of their reasoning.
   - **React**: It could also be a reaction to CallSign_Fjor's confusion about their friends' behavior.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement without any additional emotional or evaluative content.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is a direct statement based on the context provided by CallSign_Fjor.

After considering these options, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" because the speaker is providing factual information about the reason for the friends' behavior. There is no politeness or meta-act to be annotated.

",CallSign_Fjor,,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""They wanted to go through it as a group, together, as a new experience."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's query about why their friends lost interest in playing the game after they progressed further. AurelianoTampa is addressing the confusion expressed by CallSign_Fjor by explaining their friends' perspective.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa is trying to clarify or explain the reason behind the friends' behavior. The intent here is to provide an explanation or insight into the friends' mindset and motivations for not wanting to continue playing.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the friends' desires, which is verifiable in principle by asking the friends.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be interpreted as a subjective assertion about what the friends wanted, based on AurelianoTampa's understanding.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance expands on a previous point made by CallSign_Fjor about the friends' disinterest, providing additional context or explanation.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral in tone. It neither enhances nor attacks any face needs and does not employ politeness strategies or impoliteness markers.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is presented as a direct statement of what the friends wanted, without any indication of sarcasm, irony, or reported speech.  

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing an explanation that can be verified by the friends themselves. The statement is not subjective enough to be considered a Claim, and while it builds on the previous discussion, its primary function is to provide information.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""They wanted to go through it as a group, together, as a new experience."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's query about why their friends lost interest in playing the game after they progressed further. AurelianoTampa is addressing the confusion expressed by CallSign_Fjor by explaining their friends' perspective.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa is trying to clarify or explain the reason behind the friends' behavior. The intent here is to provide an explanation or insight into the friends' mindset and motivations for not wanting to continue playing.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the friends' desires, which is verifiable in principle by asking the friends.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be interpreted as a subjective assertion about what the friends wanted, based on AurelianoTampa's understanding.
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance expands on a previous point made by CallSign_Fjor about the friends' disinterest, providing additional context or explanation.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral in tone. It neither enhances nor attacks any face needs and does not employ politeness strategies or impoliteness markers.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is presented as a direct statement of what the friends wanted, without any indication of sarcasm, irony, or reported speech.  

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing an explanation that can be verified by the friends themselves. The statement is not subjective enough to be considered a Claim, and while it builds on the previous discussion, its primary function is to provide information.

28.0,1.0,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,You ruined that for them. ,CallSign_Fjor,Reply,Reject,-P [Insult],,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You ruined that for them."" is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's question about why his friends lost interest in playing games after he progressed further than them. The context reveals that CallSign_Fjor's friends felt invalidated by his faster progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is attributing the loss of interest of CallSign_Fjor's friends to CallSign_Fjor's actions. The intent here is to point out the effect of CallSign_Fjor's behavior on his friends' gaming experience.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Reject**: This could be seen as a rejection of CallSign_Fjor's perspective that he doesn't understand why his friends are discouraged. AurelianoTampa is providing an alternative viewpoint that suggests CallSign_Fjor's actions are to blame.
   - **Inform**: The utterance could be seen as providing factual information about the situation, explaining why the friends might have lost interest.
   - **Claim**: The statement could be considered a subjective assertion about CallSign_Fjor's impact on his friends' enjoyment.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The statement ""You ruined that for them."" can be perceived as impolite because it directly attributes blame to CallSign_Fjor, potentially attacking his positive face by suggesting he negatively impacted his friends' experience. This fits with Culpeper's (2011a) impoliteness formulae as a potential insult.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The statement appears to be a sincere expression of the speaker's perspective.

Based on the analysis, the primary act is **Reject** as it disputes CallSign_Fjor's understanding of the situation, and it is marked with impoliteness as it can be perceived as an attack on CallSign_Fjor's positive face.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You ruined that for them."" is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's question about why his friends lost interest in playing games after he progressed further than them. The context reveals that CallSign_Fjor's friends felt invalidated by his faster progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is attributing the loss of interest of CallSign_Fjor's friends to CallSign_Fjor's actions. The intent here is to point out the effect of CallSign_Fjor's behavior on his friends' gaming experience.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Reject**: This could be seen as a rejection of CallSign_Fjor's perspective that he doesn't understand why his friends are discouraged. AurelianoTampa is providing an alternative viewpoint that suggests CallSign_Fjor's actions are to blame.
   - **Inform**: The utterance could be seen as providing factual information about the situation, explaining why the friends might have lost interest.
   - **Claim**: The statement could be considered a subjective assertion about CallSign_Fjor's impact on his friends' enjoyment.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The statement ""You ruined that for them."" can be perceived as impolite because it directly attributes blame to CallSign_Fjor, potentially attacking his positive face by suggesting he negatively impacted his friends' experience. This fits with Culpeper's (2011a) impoliteness formulae as a potential insult.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The statement appears to be a sincere expression of the speaker's perspective.

Based on the analysis, the primary act is **Reject** as it disputes CallSign_Fjor's understanding of the situation, and it is marked with impoliteness as it can be perceived as an attack on CallSign_Fjor's positive face.

28.0,2.0,,,AurelianoTampa,,"This is more about how to manage dealing with your friends when you ignore what they want, rather than about game mechanics.",CallSign_Fjor,,Repair,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""This is more about how to manage dealing with your friends when you ignore what they want, rather than about game mechanics."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games because of unequal progression. The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to be addressing CallSign_Fjor's misunderstanding about the situation.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is attempting to explain the situation by shifting the focus from game mechanics to interpersonal relationships. They are suggesting that the issue is more about how CallSign_Fjor interacts with their friends, rather than the mechanics of the game itself. This indicates an intention to clarify or correct a misunderstanding.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Repair**: The speaker is clarifying a misunderstanding about the nature of the problem, suggesting it is about social interaction rather than game mechanics.  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about their perspective on the issue, explaining what they believe the problem is.  
   - **Reject**: The speaker might be indirectly rejecting CallSign_Fjor's understanding of the situation by presenting an alternative perspective.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness. The tone seems neutral, focusing on providing clarification rather than engaging in any face-threatening acts.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The statement appears to be sincere and straightforward.

The most appropriate act here is **Repair**, as the speaker is primarily trying to clarify what they perceive as a misunderstanding by CallSign_Fjor. The other options, while possible, do not capture the primary intent as effectively.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""This is more about how to manage dealing with your friends when you ignore what they want, rather than about game mechanics."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games because of unequal progression. The speaker, AurelianoTampa, seems to be addressing CallSign_Fjor's misunderstanding about the situation.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is attempting to explain the situation by shifting the focus from game mechanics to interpersonal relationships. They are suggesting that the issue is more about how CallSign_Fjor interacts with their friends, rather than the mechanics of the game itself. This indicates an intention to clarify or correct a misunderstanding.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Repair**: The speaker is clarifying a misunderstanding about the nature of the problem, suggesting it is about social interaction rather than game mechanics.  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about their perspective on the issue, explaining what they believe the problem is.  
   - **Reject**: The speaker might be indirectly rejecting CallSign_Fjor's understanding of the situation by presenting an alternative perspective.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness. The tone seems neutral, focusing on providing clarification rather than engaging in any face-threatening acts.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The statement appears to be sincere and straightforward.

The most appropriate act here is **Repair**, as the speaker is primarily trying to clarify what they perceive as a misunderstanding by CallSign_Fjor. The other options, while possible, do not capture the primary intent as effectively.

29.0,1.0,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,"Maybe you're better off posting this in ""Am I the Asshole?"" or a similar sub?",CallSign_Fjor,Reply,Invite,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user AurelianoTampa suggests that the original poster (OP), CallSign_Fjor, might be better off posting their query in a different subreddit, specifically ""Am I the Asshole?"" or a similar subreddit.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The suggestion to post in ""Am I the Asshole?"" implies that the OP's behavior might be questionable or subject to ethical judgment, as that subreddit is known for discussing moral dilemmas and seeking judgment from the community. The intent here seems to be advising the OP on where their post might be more relevant or receive the type of feedback they seem to be seeking.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Invite**: The suggestion to post in another subreddit can be seen as inviting the OP to consider another platform for their query.
   - **Direct**: It could also be seen as a directive, advising them to take a specific action.
   - **Reject**: There is an implicit rejection of the relevance or appropriateness of the OP's post in the current subreddit, suggesting it might be more suitable elsewhere.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is a subtle implication that the OP might be overlooking their own role in the situation, which could be seen as a mild form of criticism or condescension. However, it is not overtly impolite.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The suggestion does not appear to be sarcastic or non-bona fide; it seems to be a genuine suggestion, albeit with an underlying critique.

The most fitting act is ""Invite"" as the utterance invites the OP to consider posting in another subreddit for more appropriate feedback. There is a hint of condescension, but not strong enough to warrant a politeness tag.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user AurelianoTampa suggests that the original poster (OP), CallSign_Fjor, might be better off posting their query in a different subreddit, specifically ""Am I the Asshole?"" or a similar subreddit.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The suggestion to post in ""Am I the Asshole?"" implies that the OP's behavior might be questionable or subject to ethical judgment, as that subreddit is known for discussing moral dilemmas and seeking judgment from the community. The intent here seems to be advising the OP on where their post might be more relevant or receive the type of feedback they seem to be seeking.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Invite**: The suggestion to post in another subreddit can be seen as inviting the OP to consider another platform for their query.
   - **Direct**: It could also be seen as a directive, advising them to take a specific action.
   - **Reject**: There is an implicit rejection of the relevance or appropriateness of the OP's post in the current subreddit, suggesting it might be more suitable elsewhere.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is a subtle implication that the OP might be overlooking their own role in the situation, which could be seen as a mild form of criticism or condescension. However, it is not overtly impolite.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The suggestion does not appear to be sarcastic or non-bona fide; it seems to be a genuine suggestion, albeit with an underlying critique.

The most fitting act is ""Invite"" as the utterance invites the OP to consider posting in another subreddit for more appropriate feedback. There is a hint of condescension, but not strong enough to warrant a politeness tag.

People are legit giving you the answer and you are NOT listening.,CallSign_Fjor,Reply,Reject,-P [Condescension],,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user ""Chknbone"" is responding to ""CallSign_Fjor"" who has expressed confusion about why friends are discouraged by their faster game progression. Chknbone's message is direct and uses emphasis to convey urgency or frustration.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of Chknbone seems to be to highlight that the original poster is not acknowledging or understanding the responses they have received, despite asking for them. This is indicative of pointing out an oversight or misunderstanding on the part of the original poster.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Reject**: Chknbone is implicitly rejecting CallSign_Fjor's claim of not understanding the situation by stating they are not listening to the answers provided.
   - **Direct**: The use of ""you are NOT listening"" could be seen as a directive, telling CallSign_Fjor to pay attention.
   - **React**: The exclamation and tone suggest a reaction to perceived frustration at CallSign_Fjor's lack of understanding.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone here is somewhat confrontational, with emphasis on ""NOT listening"" and the use of ""Dude!"" suggesting frustration. This could be seen as a violation of positive politeness, as it challenges the addressee's competence or attention.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or sarcasm here. The utterance is direct and bona fide.

The most appropriate act is ""Reject"" because the speaker is challenging the original poster's claim of not understanding. The politeness value is ""-P [Condescension]"" due to the tone and emphasis used, which suggest frustration and a challenge to the addressee's competence.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user ""Chknbone"" is responding to ""CallSign_Fjor"" who has expressed confusion about why friends are discouraged by their faster game progression. Chknbone's message is direct and uses emphasis to convey urgency or frustration.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent of Chknbone seems to be to highlight that the original poster is not acknowledging or understanding the responses they have received, despite asking for them. This is indicative of pointing out an oversight or misunderstanding on the part of the original poster.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Reject**: Chknbone is implicitly rejecting CallSign_Fjor's claim of not understanding the situation by stating they are not listening to the answers provided.
   - **Direct**: The use of ""you are NOT listening"" could be seen as a directive, telling CallSign_Fjor to pay attention.
   - **React**: The exclamation and tone suggest a reaction to perceived frustration at CallSign_Fjor's lack of understanding.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone here is somewhat confrontational, with emphasis on ""NOT listening"" and the use of ""Dude!"" suggesting frustration. This could be seen as a violation of positive politeness, as it challenges the addressee's competence or attention.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or sarcasm here. The utterance is direct and bona fide.

The most appropriate act is ""Reject"" because the speaker is challenging the original poster's claim of not understanding. The politeness value is ""-P [Condescension]"" due to the tone and emphasis used, which suggest frustration and a challenge to the addressee's competence.

31.0,1.0,250127.0,,Chknbone,,Which fits given what little we know of you.,CallSign_Fjor,Reply,Claim,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Which fits given what little we know of you."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's posts about their gaming experiences and how their progress affects their friends' interest in the games.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, Chknbone, seems to be making a comment on CallSign_Fjor's behavior or personality. The phrase ""given what little we know of you"" suggests that Chknbone is drawing a conclusion or making an observation based on limited information about CallSign_Fjor.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about CallSign_Fjor based on their limited knowledge. This fits the definition of a claim as it involves an unverifiable subjective judgment.
   - **Reject**: If interpreted as dismissive or critical, it could be seen as a rejection of CallSign_Fjor's perspective or actions. However, without explicit disagreement or challenge, this is less likely.
   - **React**: The utterance could be interpreted as a simple reaction, but the use of ""fits"" implies more of an evaluative comment than a mere reaction.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The phrase has a slightly condescending tone, as it implies judgment based on limited knowledge. This could be seen as a subtle form of -P [Condescension], though it is not overtly impolite.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm in this utterance.

The primary communicative function appears to be a **Claim**, with a possible hint of condescension, but not strong enough to clearly categorize as impoliteness.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Which fits given what little we know of you."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's posts about their gaming experiences and how their progress affects their friends' interest in the games.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, Chknbone, seems to be making a comment on CallSign_Fjor's behavior or personality. The phrase ""given what little we know of you"" suggests that Chknbone is drawing a conclusion or making an observation based on limited information about CallSign_Fjor.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about CallSign_Fjor based on their limited knowledge. This fits the definition of a claim as it involves an unverifiable subjective judgment.
   - **Reject**: If interpreted as dismissive or critical, it could be seen as a rejection of CallSign_Fjor's perspective or actions. However, without explicit disagreement or challenge, this is less likely.
   - **React**: The utterance could be interpreted as a simple reaction, but the use of ""fits"" implies more of an evaluative comment than a mere reaction.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The phrase has a slightly condescending tone, as it implies judgment based on limited knowledge. This could be seen as a subtle form of -P [Condescension], though it is not overtly impolite.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm in this utterance.

The primary communicative function appears to be a **Claim**, with a possible hint of condescension, but not strong enough to clearly categorize as impoliteness.

People can feel that if someone is faking or not even trying."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's question about why people lose interest in playing when someone else has progressed further in a game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, swizz1st, seems to be explaining a possible reason for why others might lose interest. The explanation suggests that the experience is not as genuine or fulfilling when someone else has already completed the game, implying that others can sense if the person who progressed is not genuinely experiencing the game as they are.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker provides a perspective or reasoning that could be considered factual or at least an explanation for behavior.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about feelings and expressions, which are inherently unverifiable.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker could be seen as elaborating on the question posed by CallSign_Fjor by providing additional reasoning.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance does not contain any clear politeness or impoliteness markers. It is explanatory and neutral in tone.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance does not appear to be reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is presented as a sincere explanation.

Considering the intent and content, ""Claim"" is the most fitting act since the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the nature of feelings and expressions when replaying a game.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Your feeling, your expression, your joy is not the same like when you experience it for the first time. People can feel that if someone is faking or not even trying."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor's question about why people lose interest in playing when someone else has progressed further in a game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, swizz1st, seems to be explaining a possible reason for why others might lose interest. The explanation suggests that the experience is not as genuine or fulfilling when someone else has already completed the game, implying that others can sense if the person who progressed is not genuinely experiencing the game as they are.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker provides a perspective or reasoning that could be considered factual or at least an explanation for behavior.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about feelings and expressions, which are inherently unverifiable.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker could be seen as elaborating on the question posed by CallSign_Fjor by providing additional reasoning.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance does not contain any clear politeness or impoliteness markers. It is explanatory and neutral in tone.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance does not appear to be reported speech or non-bona fide communication. It is presented as a sincere explanation.

Considering the intent and content, ""Claim"" is the most fitting act since the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the nature of feelings and expressions when replaying a game.

The specific utterance is: ""Also killing a boss for the first time with hard work is way different than steam roll it after you beat the game.""

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker seems to be offering an explanation or perspective on why players might lose interest. The phrase ""killing a boss for the first time with hard work is way different than steam roll it after you beat the game"" suggests a comparison between the experience of overcoming a challenge for the first time through effort versus the diminished satisfaction of achieving the same result easily after having already completed the game.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the difference in experience between initial hard work and subsequent ease.  
   - **Inform**: If the utterance is taken as providing factual information about game experiences.
   - **Elaborate**: If it is seen as expanding on a previous point made by CallSign_Fjor.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is neutrally phrased and does not appear to engage in face-threatening or face-enhancing acts.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The utterance seems sincere and straightforward.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Claim**. The speaker is expressing a viewpoint on the subjective experience of gaming progression.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance by swizz1st is a response to CallSign_Fjor's questions and experiences about why friends lose interest in playing games when one player progresses faster. The specific utterance is: ""Also killing a boss for the first time with hard work is way different than steam roll it after you beat the game.""

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker seems to be offering an explanation or perspective on why players might lose interest. The phrase ""killing a boss for the first time with hard work is way different than steam roll it after you beat the game"" suggests a comparison between the experience of overcoming a challenge for the first time through effort versus the diminished satisfaction of achieving the same result easily after having already completed the game.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the difference in experience between initial hard work and subsequent ease.  
   - **Inform**: If the utterance is taken as providing factual information about game experiences.
   - **Elaborate**: If it is seen as expanding on a previous point made by CallSign_Fjor.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. It is neutrally phrased and does not appear to engage in face-threatening or face-enhancing acts.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The utterance seems sincere and straightforward.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Claim**. The speaker is expressing a viewpoint on the subjective experience of gaming progression.

34.0,1.0,250127.0,,Erthan-1,,"""This isn't the first time this has happened.""",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""This isn't the first time this has happened."" is a reply to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games because of the speaker's progression. The user Erthan-1 shares an experience that seems to mirror CallSign_Fjor's situation.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's intent seems to be to relate to CallSign_Fjor's situation by sharing that they have experienced something similar. This suggests a supportive or validating response, indicating that this is a recurring issue and not unique to CallSign_Fjor.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the speaker's past experience.  
   - **Congratulate**: It could be seen as validating or supporting CallSign_Fjor's feelings by showing empathy through shared experience.
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be expressing their own subjective perspective on the situation.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed. The tone is neutral and factual.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements. It is a straightforward statement of fact.

The most fitting act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing information about their similar past experiences to contribute to the conversation and relate to the original poster's situation.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""This isn't the first time this has happened."" is a reply to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games because of the speaker's progression. The user Erthan-1 shares an experience that seems to mirror CallSign_Fjor's situation.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's intent seems to be to relate to CallSign_Fjor's situation by sharing that they have experienced something similar. This suggests a supportive or validating response, indicating that this is a recurring issue and not unique to CallSign_Fjor.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the speaker's past experience.  
   - **Congratulate**: It could be seen as validating or supporting CallSign_Fjor's feelings by showing empathy through shared experience.
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be expressing their own subjective perspective on the situation.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed. The tone is neutral and factual.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements. It is a straightforward statement of fact.

The most fitting act is **Inform**, as the speaker is providing information about their similar past experiences to contribute to the conversation and relate to the original poster's situation.

You are the problem, not them.",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Reject,-P [Insult],,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""And yet you refuse to learn from it and continue to do the behavior that alienates them. You are the problem, not them."" is a direct reply to CallSign_Fjor's post about their friends losing interest in playing games with them due to their faster progression. Erthan-1 is commenting on CallSign_Fjor's behavior and attributing the problem to them rather than their friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, Erthan-1, seems to be criticizing CallSign_Fjor's behavior and attributing the blame for the alienation of friends to CallSign_Fjor. The intent is to point out that CallSign_Fjor is not learning from past experiences and continues to engage in behavior that causes issues.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Reject**: The utterance disputes CallSign_Fjor's implicit claim that the problem lies with their friends' reactions to their progression.
   - **Direct**: The speaker is indirectly advising CallSign_Fjor to change their behavior by stating that they refuse to learn from it.
   - **Claim**: The speaker asserts that CallSign_Fjor is the problem, not their friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance is critical and attributes blame to CallSign_Fjor, which can be seen as impolite. The phrase ""You are the problem, not them"" is quite direct and accusatory, potentially attacking CallSign_Fjor's positive face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is straightforward and does not contain reported speech or sarcasm.

Given the context and the directness of the criticism, the primary communicative act is **Reject**, as Erthan-1 is disputing CallSign_Fjor's perspective and attributing the blame to them. The utterance is also impolite, specifically -P [Insult], as it attacks CallSign_Fjor's positive face by calling them the problem.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""And yet you refuse to learn from it and continue to do the behavior that alienates them. You are the problem, not them."" is a direct reply to CallSign_Fjor's post about their friends losing interest in playing games with them due to their faster progression. Erthan-1 is commenting on CallSign_Fjor's behavior and attributing the problem to them rather than their friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, Erthan-1, seems to be criticizing CallSign_Fjor's behavior and attributing the blame for the alienation of friends to CallSign_Fjor. The intent is to point out that CallSign_Fjor is not learning from past experiences and continues to engage in behavior that causes issues.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Reject**: The utterance disputes CallSign_Fjor's implicit claim that the problem lies with their friends' reactions to their progression.
   - **Direct**: The speaker is indirectly advising CallSign_Fjor to change their behavior by stating that they refuse to learn from it.
   - **Claim**: The speaker asserts that CallSign_Fjor is the problem, not their friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance is critical and attributes blame to CallSign_Fjor, which can be seen as impolite. The phrase ""You are the problem, not them"" is quite direct and accusatory, potentially attacking CallSign_Fjor's positive face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance is straightforward and does not contain reported speech or sarcasm.

Given the context and the directness of the criticism, the primary communicative act is **Reject**, as Erthan-1 is disputing CallSign_Fjor's perspective and attributing the blame to them. The utterance is also impolite, specifically -P [Insult], as it attacks CallSign_Fjor's positive face by calling them the problem.

36.0,1.0,250127.0,,Wooshio,,"OP wants to be the group know it all that everyone else looks up to and relies on, instead of just having fun with their friends. Super annoying for everyone else, and a massive ego boost thing for him. Sadly he likely isn't even self aware enough to realize that's the reason he does it.",Erthan-1,Reply,Reject,-P [Insult],,"1. **Contextual Analysis**: The target utterance is a response to Erthan-1's comment, which accuses the original poster (OP) of not learning from past experiences and being the problem in their group dynamics. Wooshio's comment builds on this by suggesting that the OP's behavior is motivated by a desire for ego gratification and recognition.

2. **Speaker's Intent**: Wooshio's intent appears to be criticizing the OP's behavior, attributing it to a desire to be seen as knowledgeable and relied upon rather than genuinely engaging in fun with friends. This critique is framed as a negative assessment of the OP's motivations and self-awareness.

3. **Plausible Act Options**:  
   - **Reject**: Wooshio disagrees with the OP's self-assessment of the situation, suggesting an alternate, negative interpretation of their behavior.  
   - **Claim**: Wooshio makes an assertion about the OP's motivations and self-awareness, which is subjective and speculative.  
   - **React**: The utterance contains elements of reaction, as it expresses annoyance and criticism towards the OP's behavior.

4. **Primary Act Selection**: The primary act is **Reject** because Wooshio is directly challenging the OP's narrative and self-perception, implying that the OP's actions are not as they present them.

5. **Politeness/Impoliteness**: The utterance contains a negative assessment of the OP, suggesting they are ""super annoying"" and have a ""massive ego boost thing."" This is an attack on the OP's positive face, as it challenges their desire to be liked and respected. Thus, it qualifies as **-P [Insult]**.

6. **Meta-Acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony in this utterance. The critique seems sincere.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Contextual Analysis**: The target utterance is a response to Erthan-1's comment, which accuses the original poster (OP) of not learning from past experiences and being the problem in their group dynamics. Wooshio's comment builds on this by suggesting that the OP's behavior is motivated by a desire for ego gratification and recognition.

2. **Speaker's Intent**: Wooshio's intent appears to be criticizing the OP's behavior, attributing it to a desire to be seen as knowledgeable and relied upon rather than genuinely engaging in fun with friends. This critique is framed as a negative assessment of the OP's motivations and self-awareness.

3. **Plausible Act Options**:  
   - **Reject**: Wooshio disagrees with the OP's self-assessment of the situation, suggesting an alternate, negative interpretation of their behavior.  
   - **Claim**: Wooshio makes an assertion about the OP's motivations and self-awareness, which is subjective and speculative.  
   - **React**: The utterance contains elements of reaction, as it expresses annoyance and criticism towards the OP's behavior.

4. **Primary Act Selection**: The primary act is **Reject** because Wooshio is directly challenging the OP's narrative and self-perception, implying that the OP's actions are not as they present them.

5. **Politeness/Impoliteness**: The utterance contains a negative assessment of the OP, suggesting they are ""super annoying"" and have a ""massive ego boost thing."" This is an attack on the OP's positive face, as it challenges their desire to be liked and respected. Thus, it qualifies as **-P [Insult]**.

6. **Meta-Acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony in this utterance. The critique seems sincere.

37.0,1.0,250127.0,,sos123p9,,You took the coop out of the coop games.,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Reject,-P [Condescension],,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You took the coop out of the coop games."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor, who is questioning why their friends lost interest in playing games with them after they progressed further. CallSign_Fjor describes scenarios where their advancement or resource gathering caused friends to feel invalidated, leading them to stop playing.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""You took the coop out of the coop games."" implies that CallSign_Fjor's actions removed the cooperative element from the games, even if unintentionally. The speaker is likely critiquing or pointing out how CallSign_Fjor's actions impacted the cooperative nature of the games.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Reject**: The speaker might be rejecting CallSign_Fjor's understanding of the situation by suggesting that their actions removed the cooperative aspect.
   - **React**: The speaker could be expressing a reaction to CallSign_Fjor's actions, highlighting how it affected the gaming experience.
   - **Direct**: The speaker might be indirectly advising CallSign_Fjor to reconsider how they play cooperative games.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The statement carries a negative connotation, suggesting that CallSign_Fjor's actions were detrimental to the game's cooperative nature. This could be seen as a violation of positive politeness, as it critiques CallSign_Fjor's actions.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The statement seems to be a straightforward critique.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Reject**, as the speaker is disagreeing with or challenging CallSign_Fjor's perspective on the situation.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""You took the coop out of the coop games."" is a response to CallSign_Fjor, who is questioning why their friends lost interest in playing games with them after they progressed further. CallSign_Fjor describes scenarios where their advancement or resource gathering caused friends to feel invalidated, leading them to stop playing.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The phrase ""You took the coop out of the coop games."" implies that CallSign_Fjor's actions removed the cooperative element from the games, even if unintentionally. The speaker is likely critiquing or pointing out how CallSign_Fjor's actions impacted the cooperative nature of the games.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Reject**: The speaker might be rejecting CallSign_Fjor's understanding of the situation by suggesting that their actions removed the cooperative aspect.
   - **React**: The speaker could be expressing a reaction to CallSign_Fjor's actions, highlighting how it affected the gaming experience.
   - **Direct**: The speaker might be indirectly advising CallSign_Fjor to reconsider how they play cooperative games.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The statement carries a negative connotation, suggesting that CallSign_Fjor's actions were detrimental to the game's cooperative nature. This could be seen as a violation of positive politeness, as it critiques CallSign_Fjor's actions.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The statement seems to be a straightforward critique.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Reject**, as the speaker is disagreeing with or challenging CallSign_Fjor's perspective on the situation.

38.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,By coming back to play with them? ,sos123p9,Reply,Repair,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""By coming back to play with them?"" is a response to sos123p9's comment, ""You took the coop out of the coop games."" This suggests that sos123p9 is accusing CallSign_Fjor of disrupting the cooperative aspect of the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: CallSign_Fjor's question seems to challenge or question sos123p9's accusation. The speaker is likely trying to justify their actions or express confusion over the criticism by pointing out that they returned to play with their friends, which should contribute to the cooperative experience rather than detract from it.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Repair**: The utterance could be seen as seeking clarification or correction of a misunderstanding, questioning the accusation that they removed the cooperative aspect.
   - **Reject**: It could also be interpreted as rejecting the criticism by implying that their actions (returning to play with friends) should not be seen as taking away from the cooperative experience.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any clear politeness or impoliteness markers. It is a straightforward question seeking clarification or challenging the previous statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance.

Considering the context and the nature of the utterance, the primary function appears to be to **Repair** the perceived misunderstanding or accusation by questioning it.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it? If so why?\"" |\n\n\n1. capitalization\nsometimes the all caps make utterance \n2. reported is about perspective, particular structure fits for direct quotations is a cue for\n\n\n### II. Culpeper (2011a) Impoliteness Formulae\n*(subtypes of -P; specify in brackets)*\n\nExamples include:\n- **-P [Insult]**: \""You fucking moron\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""\n- **-P [Condescension]**: \""That's being babyish\""; \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""\n- **-P [Dismissal]**: \""Fuck off\""\n- **-P [Silencer]**: \""Shut the fuck up\""\n- **-P [Threat]**: \""I'm going to bust your head\""\n- **-P [Negative association]**: \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\""\n\n## Annotation\n\n### Procedure\n\n1. **Read the target utterance carefully** in relation to the supplied context, including background story, preceding and following messages\n2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context, not only the surface form of the message** - what is the primary communicative goal?\n3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options** and then select the primary communicative function, politeness (if strong enough), and meta-act (and subtype) when appropriate\n4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness** only if clearly expressed (not neutral interactions)\n5. **Check for meta-acts** - is this reported speech, or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm, irony, or a rhetorical question?\n6. **When reasoning is requested**, think aloud step-by-step inside [REASON]…[/REASON] following steps 1-5\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Multi-functional utterances**: Choose the primary/dominant function when an utterance is unclear or serves multiple communicative goals\n- Choose the **less frequent** act **only if multiple acts are equally plausible**, as it is typically more informative.\n  - **Most common**: claim, inform, inquire, react, elaborate\n  - **Next most common**: direct, desire, accept, reject, congratulate, request, invite\n  - **Least common**: manage, behave, thank, apologize, greet, repair\n- **Reported speech**: If the reported content contains the most important communicative act in context, annotate that rather than the reporting frame\n- **ALL CAPS**: Utterances written in ALL CAPS should be coded according to their communicative act as usual, but note that capitalization may mark emphasis or shouting. Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit. Please read the background and surrounding context carefully, then decide on the communicative act of the target utterance, its politeness value (if clearly expressed), and any applicable meta-acts. Use the CMC Communicative Act Taxonomy developed by Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005), revised in 2024 by Herring and Ge-Stadnyk, to guide your annotation. For politeness and impoliteness, refer to Herring (1994) and Culpeper's (2011a) frameworks. For meta-acts such as reported and non-bona fide speech, follow the definitions included in the taxonomy.\n\n**Background Context**: A Reddit user (CallSign_Fjor) posts in r/gaming that their friends lost interest in finishing Terraria and other games with them because the user had progressed farther, even though the user avoided using end-game gear and shared resources. The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #38.0 from CallSign_Fjor:\n\""By coming back to play with them?\""\nThe full message is:\nBy coming back to play with them?\n\nYou are asked only to annotate the utterance \""By coming back to play with them?\"".\nUtterance #38.0 is a reply to user \""sos123p9\"". The following earlier messages by sos123p9 may help contextualize the reply:\n- Utterance #37.0: \""You took the coop out of the coop games.\""\n\nOther users also replied to CallSign_Fjor afterward. Here are some such replies:\n- Utterance #40.0 from sos123p9: \""Ontop of your bonus items your brought from you playing by yourself.\""\n- Utterance #40.0 from sos123p10: \""It would have been fine if you kept them separated but you didnt.\""\n- Utterance #40.0 from sos123p11: \""Ppl play these games coop to experience them together snd you took the experience away\""\n\n**Reasoning**: Provide step-by-step analysis inside [REASON]…[/REASON] before your final answer. Follow the annotation procedure: (1) Read the target utterance in context, (2) Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent, (3) Consider 2-3 most plausible act options, (4) Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed, (5) Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.).\n\n**Output Format**: First provide your step-by-step reasoning inside [REASON]…[/REASON], then return the annotation as one JSON object wrapped EXACTLY like:\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""< META >\""}[/ANNOT]""}]","[REASON] 
1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""By coming back to play with them?"" is a response to sos123p9's comment, ""You took the coop out of the coop games."" This suggests that sos123p9 is accusing CallSign_Fjor of disrupting the cooperative aspect of the game.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: CallSign_Fjor's question seems to challenge or question sos123p9's accusation. The speaker is likely trying to justify their actions or express confusion over the criticism by pointing out that they returned to play with their friends, which should contribute to the cooperative experience rather than detract from it.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Repair**: The utterance could be seen as seeking clarification or correction of a misunderstanding, questioning the accusation that they removed the cooperative aspect.
   - **Reject**: It could also be interpreted as rejecting the criticism by implying that their actions (returning to play with friends) should not be seen as taking away from the cooperative experience.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The utterance does not contain any clear politeness or impoliteness markers. It is a straightforward question seeking clarification or challenging the previous statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance.

Considering the context and the nature of the utterance, the primary function appears to be to **Repair** the perceived misunderstanding or accusation by questioning it.
