Hence the utterance functions to give factual information to the audience—best captured by the Inform label.

The target utterance is simply “AMA,” the Reddit shorthand for “Ask Me Anything.” 
Possible labels:
1. Invite – It explicitly invites the audience to participate by asking questions.
2. Manage – Could be seen as opening the floor, managing discussion flow.

Comparing: “Invite” is defined as seeking participation or acceptance. “AMA” directly encourages others to engage with questions, fitting this definition. “Manage” is more about structuring or organizing the discussion; while AMA does open the session, its primary function is to invite questions rather than administrate structure.

No clear politeness markers (no praise, no rudeness, no hedging). Not non-bona fide.

Therefore, the most fitting act is Invite.

1. Inquire – literal question asking for information about why it matters.
2. Reject – rhetorical question challenging the relevance of the previous statement “so it all worked out,” implicitly disagreeing that it’s important.

Given the context (responding immediately to someone concluding “so it all worked out”), the utterance functions more as a challenge, disputing the implied significance rather than sincerely seeking info. Therefore, Reject fits better than Inquire. No clear politeness or impoliteness markers. No meta. [/REASON]

The phrase functions as a short supportive acknowledgment that positively evaluates the prior information. Two plausible act types:

1. Accept – would indicate explicit agreement (“Yes, that is correct”).  
2. React – signals engagement or emotional response (“Cool!”, “Wow!”).

Since “That’s cool” is more of an evaluative reaction than a direct statement of agreement, React fits better. It carries a friendly, approving tone, which can be coded as positive politeness (+P). No reporting or non-bona fide elements are present. [/REASON]

Possible acts:
1. Inform – stating a fact about the OP’s situation (“You had to choose…”).
2. Claim – a subjective characterization of the OP’s dilemma; not strictly verifiable.
Since this expresses the commenter’s empathetic assessment rather than an objectively verifiable fact, “Claim” fits better.
Politeness: The sentence shows solidarity and empathy, a form of positive politeness (+P).
No meta tags needed.

Possible acts:  
1) Claim – a subjective assertion about the speaker’s feelings (not objectively verifiable).  
2) Apologize – could be seen as an apology, but the wording doesn’t directly apologize to someone; it merely expresses regret.  
3) Desire – expresses a wish or hope? Not really; it’s reflecting current feelings, not a hypothetical want.  

Given the definitions, “Claim” fits best: it’s a personal, subjective statement. There’s no directive or request, no factual information, nor overt apology.  
Politeness: no explicit politeness strategy or impoliteness; it’s neutral.  
Meta: no reported speech, no irony. [/REASON]

Possible acts:
1) React – shows positive emotional response.
2) Congratulate – expresses praise/good wishes for an achievement (patching things up).

The utterance explicitly expresses happiness about a reconciliation, which is an accomplishment by the two parties. It’s more than a simple back-channel; it praises the result of their effort at repairing the relationship, aligning with the “Congratulate” definition. React is possible but more generic; Congratulate is the rarer, more specific fit.

Politeness: The sentence is supportive and complimentary, a clear case of positive politeness (+P).

No sarcasm or reported speech.

Therefore: act = Congratulate, politeness = +P, meta = """".

Candidate acts:  
1. Congratulate – typically praise/acknowledge an achievement (“Congrats on your promotion”). Here there’s no explicit praise for a specific achievement.  
2. Greet – covers greeting, leave-taking, and general well-wishing. The utterance is a form of well-wishing, fitting this category.  
3. Desire – expresses a want, hope, or speculation, but usually for oneself (“I wish I could …”). In this case the desire is for the addressee’s benefit and functions socially like a well-wish.

Given the taxonomy, “Greet” (well-wishing) is most appropriate.

1. Desire – expresses a hope.
2. Congratulate – expresses good wishes for success, akin to “Good luck.”

Politeness: supportive, thus +P. No meta tags needed. [/REASON]

1. Claim – the speaker states a personal feeling (“I do regret…”), a subjective assertion.
2. Desire – regret could imply a wish that things were different, fitting the “want/hope/counterfactual” definition.
3. Elaborate – could be seen as adding detail to prior statement, but content shifts from describing abuser to personal regret, not explaining previous sentence.

Between Claim and Desire: Desire is typically forward-looking (“I want”, “I wish”, “I hope”). Regret is backward-looking expression of feeling; taxonomy lists Desire examples but not regret explicitly. The utterance primarily states an internal emotional fact (“I regret…”), so Claim—an unverifiable subjective assertion—fits best. No politeness or meta markers. [/REASON]

2) Congratulate (+P): Expressing goodwill for a positive outcome/achievement (being released).

Definition of Congratulate: “Express praise or good wishes for achievement.” Saying “I’m glad you are out now” fits as goodwill for the OP’s successful release. It’s more specific than a generic reaction. Hence Congratulate is better.

Possible candidates:
1. React – It is a positive reaction showing engagement and evaluation.
2. Congratulate – Defined as “Express praise or good wishes for achievement.” Examples include compliments and encouragement like “Good luck, gamer.” The utterance explicitly praises OP’s character, so it falls under expressing praise.
3. Claim – A subjective assertion, but the social function is clearly praise rather than simply stating an opinion.

Between React and Congratulate, the taxonomy uses Congratulate for praise/compliments, while React is more neutral (e.g., “Cool!!”). Because this utterance is a direct compliment, Congratulate is the more specific and less common act, satisfying the “least frequent act preferred” rule.

Politeness: This is classic positive-politeness (+P) because it supports and compliments the addressee.

Meta: No sarcasm, no reported speech.

Therefore:
act = Congratulate

Among the act labels: 

– Accept: involves concurrence or agreement. Saying “good choice” signals that the speaker agrees with and endorses the prior choice.  
– Congratulate: typically praise for an achievement. Selecting a food or option isn’t quite an “achievement,” so this seems less fitting.  
– React: could fit as a generic positive reaction, but Accept is more specific because it conveys agreement.

Therefore, Accept is the best fit.  
Politeness: It’s praise/solidarity, so positive politeness (+P) applies.  
No special meta-tags. [/REASON]

Possible labels:

1. Inquire – asks for information.  
2. Request – could be interpreted as implicitly requesting the list, but the taxonomy distinguishes Request (asking for action) from Inquire (asking for info).

Because the user is explicitly asking for information (a factual list), Inquire is the best fit. There is no evident politeness marker or impoliteness; no sarcasm or humor tags. [/REASON]

1. React – brief evaluative response showing engagement (“Cool!”, “Eww”), often short remarks reacting to previous post.
2. Claim – subjective assertion, e.g., “I love pizza.” “You’re missing out” states an opinion that the addressee is deprived.

The utterance is a short, emotional reply triggered by “No pineapple!?”. It doesn’t elaborate facts, request action, or instruct directly; it simply expresses the speaker’s evaluative stance. Such concise evaluations typically fall under React rather than Claim, which is used for fuller propositional assertions.

Therefore React fits best. No clear politeness marking or meta (not sarcastic).[/REASON]

• A normative statement about what people (pineapple-pizza lovers) “need” to do/what should happen to them. That fits the Behave category (“call attention to social norms or expectations”).
• It’s clearly hyperbolic/joking; hence add [non-bona fide].
• It targets a group with a strong negative judgement (“need to be incarcerated”), so it counts as an insult → –P [Insult].

Other possible acts:
– Claim: It begins with “I think…”, but the substance is a prescription (“need to”), not just an opinion about taste.
– Direct: It’s not really instructing the addressee to incarcerate anyone; it’s rhetorical.

Thus, Behave is the best fit, with impoliteness and non-bona fide tags. [/REASON]

Among the communicative-act options, the ones to consider are:

1. Accept – shows concurrence or acquiescence.
2. React – could mark a short emotional response, but “fair enough” is more cognitive than emotional.
3. Claim – an opinion, but here it is not presenting a new claim; it is responding.

Because “fair enough” directly conveys agreement, “Accept” fits best. There’s no explicit politeness marker (no compliment, hedge, apology), and no sarcasm or reported speech. [/REASON]

The utterance “Don’t knock it till you try it.” is:

• An imperative addressed to others, instructing them not to criticize something before experiencing it.  
• This fits the definition of Direct: “Attempt to cause action (require, prohibit, permit, strongly advise).”  
• It is not merely providing information (Inform), nor is it asking a question (Inquire), nor expressing a desire or opinion (Claim/Desire).  
• It is stronger than a polite Request; it prohibits (“Don’t”)—so Direct is most accurate.

Politeness: While it is an imperative, it is a common idiom and not overtly rude; no clear politeness or impoliteness marker is needed.

Meta: No reported speech or sarcasm evident.

Therefore: act = Direct; no politeness/meta tags.

1) Claim – It’s a subjective assertion about how people behave (“they will believe anything and everything …”).  
2) Elaborate – It follows “It sucks…” and could be seen as explaining why it sucks.  

Elaborate is usually used when the speaker explicitly expands on their own immediately prior utterance; here, the connection is uncertain (the prior line could be another user). The central communicative force is the assertion about others’ mindset, regardless of source. This is best captured as a subjective Claim. No politeness or meta markers are evident. [/REASON]

We need one act; Claim fits better capturing evaluative nature. Politeness: provides praise/support (""excellent reason"") indicates positive politeness (+P).

Possible labels:
1. Congratulate – expressing praise or positive evaluation of addressee’s qualities (“excellent trial judge”).
2. Claim – a subjective assertion (“I believe…”).

The utterance’s main function is to compliment the OP, indicating esteem and approval. While it is phrased as a belief, the communicative impact is praise rather than merely stating an opinion. Therefore, Congratulate fits better. It also conveys positive politeness (+P).

Possible acts:
1. Desire – expresses a personal wish/intention.
2. Inform – could be seen as conveying information about future plans.
3. Claim – subjective assertion.

The core force is an expression of what the speaker wants to do (“I want to help…”). This aligns directly with Desire. It is not merely stating a fact that can be verified now (Inform), nor is it simply an opinion claim. Therefore Desire is the best fit.

No clear politeness markers, no sarcasm, no reported speech. [/REASON]

Possible acts:
1. React – shows positive engagement (“Cool!!”).
2. Congratulate – expresses praise for what the other has done.

Because the phrase is explicitly praising the person’s action/character (“legend”), it aligns with the definition of Congratulate (“express praise or good wishes for achievement”). It is also a compliment, so positive politeness (+P) applies. No sarcasm or reported speech. [/REASON]

1. Claim – expresses an assertion: abusers so often get away with it. Subjective, not verifiable.
2. React – expresses emotional evaluation of the situation (“It’s tragic”). Shows engagement with previous content.

The main function seems to be expressing an emotional evaluation in response to the story, rather than primarily advancing new information. It acknowledges the prior message and adds sentiment (“tragic”), which fits React’s definition (showing negative engagement). While it contains an assertion (“so often get away”), the communicative intent is to react with sympathy and condemnation, common for React.

Therefore, choose React. No politeness/impoliteness features. No meta tags. [/REASON]

This reverses the gratitude toward the previous speaker, which is itself an expression of thanks.  
Alternative possibilities:
1. Accept – could be agreeing that thanks are due, but the main function is to express gratitude back.
2. Thank – direct act of thanking, fits best.

Politeness: thanking is a clear act of positive politeness (compliment/solidarity).

However, the speaker immediately answers their own question in the next utterance (“No.”). This indicates it is not a genuine request for information from others but a rhetorical question used to set up their self-answer. In the taxonomy, rhetorical questions are still coded for their surface act (Inquire) and tagged with [non-bona fide]. There is no agreement/disagreement or directive here, and no clear politeness move. Therefore the best fit is Inquire with a non-bona fide meta tag. [/REASON]

The target reply asks, “Who wanted this guy dead?”  Taken literally, it is a question, but in context it is rhetorical: the speaker is implying that the answer (the teenager) is obvious, thereby challenging the claim that the killing couldn’t be traced back. Thus the utterance functions to dispute/contradict the prior statement.  
Hence primary act = Reject.  
Since it’s rhetorical, mark meta as [non-bona fide]. No clear politeness or impoliteness. [/REASON]

Possible acts:
1. Inform – providing factual information about legal standards (a suspicion alone doesn’t result in jail).
2. Claim – subjective assertion; but here it’s presented as an objective fact about the justice system, potentially verifiable.

Given the context (discussing how a case must be built before arrest), the utterance functions to clarify/provide legal information. Therefore Inform fits best.

No politeness or impoliteness markers, no reported speech, no humor.

Possible acts:  
1. Inform – providing factual information that people were unaware of the friend.  
2. Claim – but Claim is for subjective/unverifiable assertions, whereas this statement is an objective fact within the story timeline and could in principle be verified.  
No directive, inquiry, acceptance, etc. present.  
Therefore “Inform” best fits.  
No politeness markers or impoliteness.  
No sarcasm or reported speech. [/REASON]

In the taxonomy there is no dedicated “condole” act, so expressions of empathy fall under “React,” which covers emotional responses that show engagement.

Within the taxonomy, “Congratulate” is defined as “express praise or good wishes for achievement” and examples include “Good luck, gamer.” This fits: it’s a goodwill/well-wishing statement rather than an internal desire for oneself.  
Desire could be considered because it uses “I hope,” but Desire typically involves expressing one’s own wants or hypothetical situations; here the focus is on benevolently wishing the interlocutor well, aligning more with Congratulate.  
Politeness: it’s clearly supportive and friendly, so positive politeness (+P).

The target reply “Ehh not really.” expresses disagreement with that praise, downplaying the compliment.  
Possible acts:  
1) Reject – disagreeing with the assessment.  
2) Apologize – it’s not apologetic; no apology.  
3) React – a simple response, but it specifically negates the prior claim.  

Most fitting: Reject, since it explicitly refutes the evaluation that they are “a hero.”

Given the sentence states a putatively verifiable fact about services, it best fits Inform. There’s no explicit politeness strategy or impoliteness. No sarcasm. [/REASON]

Possible acts:  
1) Inform – giving (purportedly) factual information about legal consequences.  
2) Claim – a subjective assertion.  

The speaker presents it as an objective outcome (“best case scenario”), i.e., a legal fact that could be checked, rather than a personal preference or evaluation. In Reddit discourse, such statements about the law are typically treated as facts. Therefore Inform fits better than Claim.

No direct agreement/disagreement, no request or directive.  
No politeness cues; no insults.

Thus: act = Inform, politeness = none, meta = none. [/REASON]

2) Claim – Could be a subjective assertion about having a brain.
3) React – An emotional reaction (“I can’t believe …”).

Check context: Previous line talks about reducing sentence; OP says nobody else is against murder. They are positioning themselves against others’ stance, implicitly rejecting the pro-murder view. Thus main force = disagreement → Reject. Tone includes “I’m the only one with a brain here,” which insults the others, violating positive politeness → –P [Insult].

Literally, that is phrased as a desire/wish. Yet, from context, it’s clearly sarcastic because such laws already exist; the next utterance (“I forgot, there is.”) confirms the irony.  
Potential acts:  
1. Desire – fits the surface “I wish” construction, which in the taxonomy covers expressions of wish/hope/counterfactual.  
2. Claim – could be seen as a sarcastic assertion that there are no such laws, but the primary grammatical form is a wish.  
Given the taxonomy and examples, “Desire” is the best match. We add meta tag [non-bona fide] for the sarcasm/irony. No impoliteness or politeness markers present. [/REASON]

The target reply “I forgot, there is.” is pointing out that such laws actually do exist, correcting the misconception. Two candidate labels:

1. Repair – correcting a misunderstanding or error in the previous utterance.
2. Reject – simply disagreeing with the previous content.

While it does reject the prior implication, its primary function is to correct that error (“there is [a law]”), which fits the definition of Repair more precisely. There’s no overt insult or sarcasm strong enough to tag impoliteness; it’s a straightforward correction. [/REASON]

1. Claim – The utterance presents a stance that the crimes do not justify murder; it could be viewed as a subjective assertion.
2. Reject – The speaker is countering (disagreeing with) the implicit/explicit argument that the boyfriend’s crimes justify killing him.

Context: The preceding comment criticizes someone for assuming the boyfriend would fear trespassing despite committing other crimes; the thread debates the moral/legal justification of the shooting. The target sentence directly challenges any justification for the murder (“still not a justification”). This functions primarily as a disagreement/challenge rather than merely stating a neutral opinion.

Therefore, “Reject” fits best. No insults or imperatives, so no politeness/impoliteness markers. No sarcasm. [/REASON]

The prior comment defends OP’s action as the only way to protect his sister. The target responds: “Still doesn’t excuse murder.” This directly disagrees with the justification offered, challenging the prior statement. Primary options:
1. Reject – Expresses disagreement/refutation.
2. Claim – Could be seen as an assertion of opinion.

Because it explicitly counters the previous utterance, the function is rebuttal, fitting Reject. No insults or politeness markers. No sarcasm, so no meta tags.

The utterance is primarily an evaluative stance: “He absolutely deserved…” indicates personal opinion rather than purely conveying facts. Although it references legal practices, the core function is expressing judgment. Thus Claim fits best. No politeness markers, no meta. [/REASON]
