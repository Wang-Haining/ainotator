1,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,Inquire,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"". This is the title of a Reddit post where the author, CallSign_Fjor, describes personal experiences of friends quitting games after the author progressed further. The author expresses confusion (""I don't get it,"" ""I do not understand the mentality..."") and is looking for an explanation for this behavior from the r/gaming community.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is genuinely puzzled by a social dynamic they have encountered repeatedly. The phrasing ""What's up with..."" is a common colloquial way to ask for an explanation or reason for something. The speaker's primary goal is to solicit information, opinions, and insights from other redditors to understand why their friends acted the way they did.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inquire**: This is the most direct fit. The utterance is a question seeking information and explanation. The definition ""Seek information, ask"" perfectly describes the speaker's intent. The rest of the post reinforces this, as it's a plea for understanding.
    *   **Claim**: One could argue it's a rhetorical question that makes an implicit claim, such as ""It's unreasonable for people to quit a game because someone else has progressed further."" However, the context of a discussion forum and the genuine tone of confusion in the body of the post suggest the speaker is truly seeking answers, not just asserting an opinion. Replies from other users treat it as a genuine question to be answered.
    *   **Manage**: As the title of the post, the utterance serves to ""open"" the discussion. However, the primary communicative function is contained within the content of the question itself, not just its structural role. The act of asking for information is more central to the speaker's goal than the meta-act of starting a thread. Therefore, `Inquire` is more specific and accurate.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is phrased as a general question about ""people."" It is not directed at a specific person in an aggressive or overly deferential way. The tone is neutral and inquisitive. There are no clear markers of positive/negative politeness or impoliteness.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance is the speaker's own thought, not a report of someone else's speech.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The question is sincere. The speaker genuinely wants to know the answer. It is not sarcastic, ironic, or rhetorical in the sense of not expecting an answer.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is `Inquire`.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). ,,Original post,Inform,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is the opening paragraph of a Reddit post where the author, CallSign_Fjor, sets up a situation to ask a question. The utterance is: ""Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons)."" This utterance functions as the backstory for the central conflict and question of the post.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to provide a factual account of past events. They are reporting a sequence of actions and observations to give the reader the necessary context to understand the problem that follows (their friends losing interest). The intent is to state what happened from their perspective.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inform**: This act is defined as providing ""factual"" information that is verifiable in principle. The utterance is a narrative recounting of events: playing with friends, playing alone, rejoining the group, and a friend's observation. This aligns perfectly with the definition of reporting factual information.
    *   **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. While the statement ""They were moving a bit slow"" is a subjective judgment, the rest of the long utterance is a report of actions (""I started a single player world and finished it,"" ""I used none of my new gear""). The primary function of the entire utterance is not to opine but to narrate the events. Therefore, Inform is a better fit for the overall utterance.
    *   **Elaborate**: This act involves commenting on or explaining a previous utterance. As this is the first detailed part of the post after the title, it is not elaborating on a prior statement but rather establishing the initial premise.

    Comparing these, **Inform** is the most accurate label for the primary communicative function of this utterance, which is to report a series of events.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual recounting of events. It does not contain any language that clearly expresses positive politeness (like praise or support for the reader) or negative politeness (like hedging or apologies). It also does not attack the face of any party. Therefore, it is neutral in terms of politeness.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance contains the phrase ""someone noted that I had extra stuff"". This is a report of another person's speech act. However, this is just one component of a much larger narrative. The primary function of the entire annotated segment is the speaker's own act of informing the audience about the whole sequence of events, not just relaying what the friend said. The reported act is not the main point of the utterance, but rather one event in the sequence being reported. Therefore, the [reported] meta-act is not applied to the entire utterance.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, joking, or any other form of insincerity. The speaker is presenting the situation as a genuine problem.

Based on this analysis, the correct annotation is **Inform**, with no politeness or meta-act tags.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is the opening paragraph of a Reddit post where the author, CallSign_Fjor, sets up a situation to ask a question. The utterance is: ""Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons)."" This utterance functions as the backstory for the central conflict and question of the post.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to provide a factual account of past events. They are reporting a sequence of actions and observations to give the reader the necessary context to understand the problem that follows (their friends losing interest). The intent is to state what happened from their perspective.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inform**: This act is defined as providing ""factual"" information that is verifiable in principle. The utterance is a narrative recounting of events: playing with friends, playing alone, rejoining the group, and a friend's observation. This aligns perfectly with the definition of reporting factual information.
    *   **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. While the statement ""They were moving a bit slow"" is a subjective judgment, the rest of the long utterance is a report of actions (""I started a single player world and finished it,"" ""I used none of my new gear""). The primary function of the entire utterance is not to opine but to narrate the events. Therefore, Inform is a better fit for the overall utterance.
    *   **Elaborate**: This act involves commenting on or explaining a previous utterance. As this is the first detailed part of the post after the title, it is not elaborating on a prior statement but rather establishing the initial premise.

    Comparing these, **Inform** is the most accurate label for the primary communicative function of this utterance, which is to report a series of events.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual recounting of events. It does not contain any language that clearly expresses positive politeness (like praise or support for the reader) or negative politeness (like hedging or apologies). It also does not attack the face of any party. Therefore, it is neutral in terms of politeness.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance contains the phrase ""someone noted that I had extra stuff"". This is a report of another person's speech act. However, this is just one component of a much larger narrative. The primary function of the entire annotated segment is the speaker's own act of informing the audience about the whole sequence of events, not just relaying what the friend said. The reported act is not the main point of the utterance, but rather one event in the sequence being reported. Therefore, the [reported] meta-act is not applied to the entire utterance.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, joking, or any other form of insincerity. The speaker is presenting the situation as a genuine problem.

Based on this analysis, the correct annotation is **Inform**, with no politeness or meta-act tags.

2,2,,,CallSign_Fjor,,"When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. ",,,Inform,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is the original poster, providing a narrative to explain why they are asking the question, ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"". This utterance is a key piece of the backstory, explaining the specific event that prompted the post.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's goal is to recount a past event factually. They are stating what happened: they made a statement to their friends, and their friends reacted in a specific way (by losing interest and stopping playing). The primary function is to provide this information to the reader as part of a larger narrative.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: This seems to be the best fit. The definition is ""Provide 'factual' information that is verifiable in principle... inform, state, report..."". The speaker is reporting a sequence of events that they present as factual. This utterance serves to inform the audience about what transpired.
    *   **Claim**: This is a possibility because it involves the friends' state of mind (""uninterested""). However, the main thrust of the utterance is the reporting of an observable outcome (they ""haven't joined back on"") as a consequence of the speaker's statement. The speaker is presenting the entire event as a fact, not just speculating on their friends' feelings. Therefore, `Inform` is more accurate as it covers the reporting of the entire event sequence.
    *   **Elaborate**: This is less likely. The utterance follows a description of having extra items in the game. While it continues the story, it doesn't primarily comment on, explain, or paraphrase the preceding sentence. Instead, it introduces a new, crucial event in the timeline.

    Comparing these, `Inform` best captures the primary function of reporting a past event to the audience.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual recounting of events. There is no specific linguistic marking of politeness or impoliteness towards the reader or the people being described. The tone is descriptive. Therefore, no politeness code is applicable.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance contains reported speech (""I told them I went and beat the game...""). However, the primary communicative act is not just conveying the content of what was said. The main point for the audience is the entire cause-and-effect event: ""When I said X, Y happened."" The speaker is informing the Reddit audience of this whole situation. The act of telling is part of the event being reported, not merely a frame for an embedded act. Therefore, the entire utterance functions as a direct `Inform` to the current audience, and the `[reported]` tag is not necessary as it doesn't capture the function of the whole sentence.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate annotation is `Inform`.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is the original poster, providing a narrative to explain why they are asking the question, ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"". This utterance is a key piece of the backstory, explaining the specific event that prompted the post.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's goal is to recount a past event factually. They are stating what happened: they made a statement to their friends, and their friends reacted in a specific way (by losing interest and stopping playing). The primary function is to provide this information to the reader as part of a larger narrative.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: This seems to be the best fit. The definition is ""Provide 'factual' information that is verifiable in principle... inform, state, report..."". The speaker is reporting a sequence of events that they present as factual. This utterance serves to inform the audience about what transpired.
    *   **Claim**: This is a possibility because it involves the friends' state of mind (""uninterested""). However, the main thrust of the utterance is the reporting of an observable outcome (they ""haven't joined back on"") as a consequence of the speaker's statement. The speaker is presenting the entire event as a fact, not just speculating on their friends' feelings. Therefore, `Inform` is more accurate as it covers the reporting of the entire event sequence.
    *   **Elaborate**: This is less likely. The utterance follows a description of having extra items in the game. While it continues the story, it doesn't primarily comment on, explain, or paraphrase the preceding sentence. Instead, it introduces a new, crucial event in the timeline.

    Comparing these, `Inform` best captures the primary function of reporting a past event to the audience.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual recounting of events. There is no specific linguistic marking of politeness or impoliteness towards the reader or the people being described. The tone is descriptive. Therefore, no politeness code is applicable.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance contains reported speech (""I told them I went and beat the game...""). However, the primary communicative act is not just conveying the content of what was said. The main point for the audience is the entire cause-and-effect event: ""When I said X, Y happened."" The speaker is informing the Reddit audience of this whole situation. The act of telling is part of the event being reported, not merely a frame for an embedded act. Therefore, the entire utterance functions as a direct `Inform` to the current audience, and the `[reported]` tag is not necessary as it doesn't capture the function of the whole sentence.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate annotation is `Inform`.

2,3,,,CallSign_Fjor,,It's been a week ,,,Inform,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""It's been a week"". It is part of a larger sentence: ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is recounting a story to a general Reddit audience, explaining that their friends have stopped playing a game with them.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's goal is to provide evidence for the preceding statement that their friends ""haven't joined back on."" The utterance ""It's been a week"" quantifies the duration of their friends' absence, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and supporting the overall narrative of abandonment. The primary intent is to state a fact that strengthens their point.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: This act is defined as providing ""'factual' information that is verifiable in principle."" The statement ""It's been a week"" is a factual report about the passage of time. It informs the reader of a specific detail of the story. This is a very strong candidate.
    *   **Elaborate**: This act is defined as commenting on or explaining a previous utterance. The utterance ""It's been a week"" adds specific detail to the more general statement ""haven't joined back on."" It explains the extent or duration of their absence. This is also a plausible option.
    *   **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. ""It's been a week"" is presented as an objective, verifiable fact, not a personal opinion or feeling. Therefore, `Inform` is a better fit than `Claim`.

    Between `Inform` and `Elaborate`, both are plausible. However, the utterance introduces a new, specific piece of data (the duration) into the narrative. Its primary function is to report this fact to the audience to support the story. While it does elaborate, its core function is informational. Therefore, `Inform` is the most direct and accurate label for the primary communicative function.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual statement made as part of a narrative. It does not express any positive or negative politeness towards the addressee (the Reddit audience) or the friends being discussed. It is communicatively neutral in terms of politeness.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The speaker is not reporting what someone else said.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The statement is presented sincerely and literally. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Therefore, no meta-act is applicable. The final decision is `Inform`.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""It's been a week"". It is part of a larger sentence: ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is recounting a story to a general Reddit audience, explaining that their friends have stopped playing a game with them.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's goal is to provide evidence for the preceding statement that their friends ""haven't joined back on."" The utterance ""It's been a week"" quantifies the duration of their friends' absence, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and supporting the overall narrative of abandonment. The primary intent is to state a fact that strengthens their point.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: This act is defined as providing ""'factual' information that is verifiable in principle."" The statement ""It's been a week"" is a factual report about the passage of time. It informs the reader of a specific detail of the story. This is a very strong candidate.
    *   **Elaborate**: This act is defined as commenting on or explaining a previous utterance. The utterance ""It's been a week"" adds specific detail to the more general statement ""haven't joined back on."" It explains the extent or duration of their absence. This is also a plausible option.
    *   **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. ""It's been a week"" is presented as an objective, verifiable fact, not a personal opinion or feeling. Therefore, `Inform` is a better fit than `Claim`.

    Between `Inform` and `Elaborate`, both are plausible. However, the utterance introduces a new, specific piece of data (the duration) into the narrative. Its primary function is to report this fact to the audience to support the story. While it does elaborate, its core function is informational. Therefore, `Inform` is the most direct and accurate label for the primary communicative function.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual statement made as part of a narrative. It does not express any positive or negative politeness towards the addressee (the Reddit audience) or the friends being discussed. It is communicatively neutral in terms of politeness.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The speaker is not reporting what someone else said.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The statement is presented sincerely and literally. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Therefore, no meta-act is applicable. The final decision is `Inform`.

2,4,,,CallSign_Fjor,,and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.,,,Inform,,reported,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining to a Reddit audience why their friends stopped playing a game with them. This utterance provides the specific reason the friends gave.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's main goal here is to convey the reason (which they label an ""excuse"") that their friends provided for quitting the game. The core of the message is the content of that reason.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information to the audience about what their friends said. They are reporting the friends' stated justification. This is a strong candidate.
    *   **Claim**: The use of the word ""excuse"" introduces a subjective judgment, suggesting the speaker believes the reason given is not the real or a valid one. This makes the utterance an opinion or a claim about the nature of the friends' reasoning.
    *   **Elaborate**: The utterance explains the preceding statement (""three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on""). It provides the ""why."" This is also plausible.

4.  **Select the primary function and check for meta-acts**:
    *   The structure of the utterance is ""their excuse is that [reported proposition]"". The instruction for reported acts states: ""In the case of reported acts, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most relevant for act analysis, in which case the act code is assigned to it, rather than to the matrix (embedding) clause.""
    *   The embedded proposition is ""[he has] already explored everything and beat the game."" This is a statement of fact from the friends' perspective. They are informing the speaker of the facts that led to their decision. Therefore, the act of the reported content is **Inform**.
    *   Following the guideline, we should code the act of the embedded proposition. This makes the primary act **Inform**.
    *   The meta-act **[reported]** is clearly applicable, as the speaker is reporting what their friends said or implied. The word ""that"" signals indirect reported speech.
    *   Comparing `Inform [reported]` with `Claim`: While ""excuse"" adds a layer of claim, the primary communicative work is conveying the *content* of the friends' reason. The `[reported]` meta-act rule directs us to focus on that content, which is informational.
    *   Comparing `Inform [reported]` with `Elaborate`: While it does elaborate, `Inform` is more specific here because it involves introducing new information from an external source (the friends), rather than just rephrasing or clarifying the speaker's own previous point.

5.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is part of a narrative explaining a situation. While the word ""excuse"" carries a slightly negative valence towards the friends, it is not a direct politeness or impoliteness act aimed at the audience or a present interlocutor. The tone is neutral in the context of explaining the situation to Reddit. Therefore, no politeness code is needed.

Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining to a Reddit audience why their friends stopped playing a game with them. This utterance provides the specific reason the friends gave.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's main goal here is to convey the reason (which they label an ""excuse"") that their friends provided for quitting the game. The core of the message is the content of that reason.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information to the audience about what their friends said. They are reporting the friends' stated justification. This is a strong candidate.
    *   **Claim**: The use of the word ""excuse"" introduces a subjective judgment, suggesting the speaker believes the reason given is not the real or a valid one. This makes the utterance an opinion or a claim about the nature of the friends' reasoning.
    *   **Elaborate**: The utterance explains the preceding statement (""three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on""). It provides the ""why."" This is also plausible.

4.  **Select the primary function and check for meta-acts**:
    *   The structure of the utterance is ""their excuse is that [reported proposition]"". The instruction for reported acts states: ""In the case of reported acts, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most relevant for act analysis, in which case the act code is assigned to it, rather than to the matrix (embedding) clause.""
    *   The embedded proposition is ""[he has] already explored everything and beat the game."" This is a statement of fact from the friends' perspective. They are informing the speaker of the facts that led to their decision. Therefore, the act of the reported content is **Inform**.
    *   Following the guideline, we should code the act of the embedded proposition. This makes the primary act **Inform**.
    *   The meta-act **[reported]** is clearly applicable, as the speaker is reporting what their friends said or implied. The word ""that"" signals indirect reported speech.
    *   Comparing `Inform [reported]` with `Claim`: While ""excuse"" adds a layer of claim, the primary communicative work is conveying the *content* of the friends' reason. The `[reported]` meta-act rule directs us to focus on that content, which is informational.
    *   Comparing `Inform [reported]` with `Elaborate`: While it does elaborate, `Inform` is more specific here because it involves introducing new information from an external source (the friends), rather than just rephrasing or clarifying the speaker's own previous point.

5.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is part of a narrative explaining a situation. While the word ""excuse"" carries a slightly negative valence towards the friends, it is not a direct politeness or impoliteness act aimed at the audience or a present interlocutor. The tone is neutral in the context of explaining the situation to Reddit. Therefore, no politeness code is needed.

6.  **Final check**: The act is **Inform**, and the meta-act is **[reported]**. There is no strong politeness expressed. The annotation `{""act"":""Inform"", ""meta"":""reported""}` accurately captures the function of this utterance in its context.

At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.,,Original post,Inform,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources."" It is part of the original post where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is trying to understand why their friends get discouraged when the speaker progresses faster in a game. This utterance follows a previous example about the game Terraria and serves to establish a pattern of behavior.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's intent is to provide a second, concrete example to support their general observation that ""this has happened before."" They are recounting a past event from the game ""Pax Dei"" to give evidence for the problem they are describing. The main goal is to present this event as a piece of factual information for the audience to consider.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: This seems like the strongest candidate. The utterance provides factual information about a past event (""At one point in Pax Dei...""). The events described—mining, a player quitting, giving resources—are presented as facts that are, in principle, verifiable. The speaker is reporting on what happened to support their larger argument.
    *   **Elaborate**: This is also a possibility. The utterance begins with ""This isn't the first time this has happened,"" and the rest of the text elaborates on that statement by providing a specific instance. However, the primary function of the entire message in the context of the whole post is to provide a new piece of evidence, a new report of an event. While it does elaborate on the sentence that precedes it, its main function in the discourse is to inform the reader of another case study. Given the definition ""Provide 'factual' information... state, report,"" **Inform** captures the essence of reporting this past event more accurately than Elaborate.
    *   **Claim**: This is less likely. A claim is a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. While the *reasons* for the friend quitting might be subjective, the speaker is stating the events themselves (mining, quitting) as facts. Therefore, Inform is a better fit.

    Comparing the options, **Inform** is the most appropriate label because the core function is to report a past event as a factual basis for the discussion.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual recounting of events. The speaker does not use any language that is explicitly polite or impolite towards the reader or the people mentioned in the story. The tone is descriptive. Therefore, no politeness code is warranted.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The speaker is reporting on events, but not on a specific speech act. They are not saying ""My friend said 'I quit'."" They are describing an action. Thus, the [reported] meta-act does not apply.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in their post. There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or joking. They are genuinely seeking to understand a situation. Therefore, the [non-bona fide] meta-act does not apply.

Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources."" It is part of the original post where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is trying to understand why their friends get discouraged when the speaker progresses faster in a game. This utterance follows a previous example about the game Terraria and serves to establish a pattern of behavior.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's intent is to provide a second, concrete example to support their general observation that ""this has happened before."" They are recounting a past event from the game ""Pax Dei"" to give evidence for the problem they are describing. The main goal is to present this event as a piece of factual information for the audience to consider.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: This seems like the strongest candidate. The utterance provides factual information about a past event (""At one point in Pax Dei...""). The events described—mining, a player quitting, giving resources—are presented as facts that are, in principle, verifiable. The speaker is reporting on what happened to support their larger argument.
    *   **Elaborate**: This is also a possibility. The utterance begins with ""This isn't the first time this has happened,"" and the rest of the text elaborates on that statement by providing a specific instance. However, the primary function of the entire message in the context of the whole post is to provide a new piece of evidence, a new report of an event. While it does elaborate on the sentence that precedes it, its main function in the discourse is to inform the reader of another case study. Given the definition ""Provide 'factual' information... state, report,"" **Inform** captures the essence of reporting this past event more accurately than Elaborate.
    *   **Claim**: This is less likely. A claim is a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. While the *reasons* for the friend quitting might be subjective, the speaker is stating the events themselves (mining, quitting) as facts. Therefore, Inform is a better fit.

    Comparing the options, **Inform** is the most appropriate label because the core function is to report a past event as a factual basis for the discussion.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is a neutral, factual recounting of events. The speaker does not use any language that is explicitly polite or impolite towards the reader or the people mentioned in the story. The tone is descriptive. Therefore, no politeness code is warranted.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The speaker is reporting on events, but not on a specific speech act. They are not saying ""My friend said 'I quit'."" They are describing an action. Thus, the [reported] meta-act does not apply.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in their post. There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or joking. They are genuinely seeking to understand a situation. Therefore, the [non-bona fide] meta-act does not apply.

Based on this analysis, the final annotation is **Inform**.

3,2,,,CallSign_Fjor,,Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,,Claim,,reported,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" It is part of a larger post where the speaker (CallSign_Fjor) describes an incident where a friend quit a game. This specific sentence provides the reason the friend gave for quitting.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to report the friend's perspective or stated reason for quitting the game. The speaker is not making this claim themselves; they are relaying information about what their friend thought or said.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about a past event—specifically, what their friend's stance was. The framing ""Their stance was..."" is an act of informing the audience.
    *   **Elaborate**: The utterance explains the preceding statement (""...the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit...""). It provides the 'why' for the friend's action, thus elaborating on it.
    *   **Claim**: The core content of the utterance is the friend's assertion that the speaker ""invalidated them."" This assertion is subjective and unverifiable, describing a state of mind, which fits the definition of a Claim.

4.  **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance has a clear reporting structure: ""Their stance was that [X]"". The speaker is reporting the friend's position. This calls for the **[reported]** meta-act. The annotation guidelines state that for reported acts, we should code the communicative act of the embedded utterance if it is the most relevant part. The embedded utterance is ""[I] invalidated them."" The relevance of this sentence lies in the *content* of the friend's stance, not just the fact that the speaker is reporting it. The friend's feeling of invalidation is the central point of the speaker's confusion. Therefore, I will annotate the embedded act.

5.  **Analyze the embedded act**: The embedded proposition, ""[I] invalidated them,"" is a subjective assertion about a feeling or state of mind. It is not a verifiable fact. This perfectly matches the definition of a **Claim**: ""Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief.""

6.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The speaker is neutrally reporting a past event and another person's viewpoint. There is no clear positive or negative politeness directed at the audience. The utterance is neutral in tone.

7.  **Final Decision**: The primary communicative function is to report the friend's subjective assertion. Following the guidelines for reported speech, the act of the embedded clause (""I invalidated them"") is the most relevant. This is a **Claim**. The reporting nature of the utterance is captured by the **[reported]** meta-act. The politeness is neutral. Therefore, the correct annotation is **Claim [reported]**.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" It is part of a larger post where the speaker (CallSign_Fjor) describes an incident where a friend quit a game. This specific sentence provides the reason the friend gave for quitting.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to report the friend's perspective or stated reason for quitting the game. The speaker is not making this claim themselves; they are relaying information about what their friend thought or said.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about a past event—specifically, what their friend's stance was. The framing ""Their stance was..."" is an act of informing the audience.
    *   **Elaborate**: The utterance explains the preceding statement (""...the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit...""). It provides the 'why' for the friend's action, thus elaborating on it.
    *   **Claim**: The core content of the utterance is the friend's assertion that the speaker ""invalidated them."" This assertion is subjective and unverifiable, describing a state of mind, which fits the definition of a Claim.

4.  **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance has a clear reporting structure: ""Their stance was that [X]"". The speaker is reporting the friend's position. This calls for the **[reported]** meta-act. The annotation guidelines state that for reported acts, we should code the communicative act of the embedded utterance if it is the most relevant part. The embedded utterance is ""[I] invalidated them."" The relevance of this sentence lies in the *content* of the friend's stance, not just the fact that the speaker is reporting it. The friend's feeling of invalidation is the central point of the speaker's confusion. Therefore, I will annotate the embedded act.

5.  **Analyze the embedded act**: The embedded proposition, ""[I] invalidated them,"" is a subjective assertion about a feeling or state of mind. It is not a verifiable fact. This perfectly matches the definition of a **Claim**: ""Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief.""

6.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The speaker is neutrally reporting a past event and another person's viewpoint. There is no clear positive or negative politeness directed at the audience. The utterance is neutral in tone.

7.  **Final Decision**: The primary communicative function is to report the friend's subjective assertion. Following the guidelines for reported speech, the act of the embedded clause (""I invalidated them"") is the most relevant. This is a **Claim**. The reporting nature of the utterance is captured by the **[reported]** meta-act. The politeness is neutral. Therefore, the correct annotation is **Claim [reported]**.

4,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,"I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?",,Original post,Inquire,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?"". The speaker (OP) is explaining a situation where their friends quit playing games with them because the OP progressed faster. This utterance is part of the original post where the OP is asking the r/gaming community for an explanation of their friends' behavior.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to understand the reasoning behind their friends' actions. The utterance is framed by ""I don't get it,"" which signals genuine confusion, and is followed by two direct ""why"" questions. The speaker is seeking information and an explanation from the community.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inquire**: This is the most fitting option. The definition is ""Seek information, ask"". The utterance is composed of two direct questions (""why wouldn't you want...?"", ""Why does me getting...?""). The speaker is explicitly asking for information to resolve their confusion.
    *   **Claim**: One could argue the utterance is a claim about the speaker's state of mind (""I don't get it""). However, this phrase serves as a preface to the main communicative work of the utterance, which is asking the questions that follow. The questions are the dominant function, not the statement of confusion.
    *   **Reject**: The questions implicitly challenge or reject the friends' perspective. By asking ""why wouldn't you want..."", the speaker implies that one *should* want that. However, the primary goal is not to argue with the friends (who are not the direct addressees) but to solicit an explanation from the Reddit audience. Therefore, seeking information (Inquire) is the more accurate primary function over disputing a viewpoint (Reject).

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance expresses the speaker's frustration and confusion, but it is not directed at the addressees (the Reddit community) in a way that is clearly polite or impolite. It is a neutral, information-seeking question posed to the forum. Therefore, no politeness code is warranted.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **Reported**: The utterance is a direct expression of the speaker's own thoughts, not reported speech.
    *   **Non-bona fide**: The questions are genuine. The speaker truly does not understand and is seeking an answer. They are not rhetorical questions where the answer is implied or obvious to the speaker. Therefore, the utterance is bona fide.

**Conclusion**: The primary communicative act is **Inquire**, as the speaker is directly asking for information to understand a situation. There are no strong politeness markers, and it is a sincere (bona fide) question.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?"". The speaker (OP) is explaining a situation where their friends quit playing games with them because the OP progressed faster. This utterance is part of the original post where the OP is asking the r/gaming community for an explanation of their friends' behavior.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to understand the reasoning behind their friends' actions. The utterance is framed by ""I don't get it,"" which signals genuine confusion, and is followed by two direct ""why"" questions. The speaker is seeking information and an explanation from the community.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inquire**: This is the most fitting option. The definition is ""Seek information, ask"". The utterance is composed of two direct questions (""why wouldn't you want...?"", ""Why does me getting...?""). The speaker is explicitly asking for information to resolve their confusion.
    *   **Claim**: One could argue the utterance is a claim about the speaker's state of mind (""I don't get it""). However, this phrase serves as a preface to the main communicative work of the utterance, which is asking the questions that follow. The questions are the dominant function, not the statement of confusion.
    *   **Reject**: The questions implicitly challenge or reject the friends' perspective. By asking ""why wouldn't you want..."", the speaker implies that one *should* want that. However, the primary goal is not to argue with the friends (who are not the direct addressees) but to solicit an explanation from the Reddit audience. Therefore, seeking information (Inquire) is the more accurate primary function over disputing a viewpoint (Reject).

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance expresses the speaker's frustration and confusion, but it is not directed at the addressees (the Reddit community) in a way that is clearly polite or impolite. It is a neutral, information-seeking question posed to the forum. Therefore, no politeness code is warranted.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **Reported**: The utterance is a direct expression of the speaker's own thoughts, not reported speech.
    *   **Non-bona fide**: The questions are genuine. The speaker truly does not understand and is seeking an answer. They are not rhetorical questions where the answer is implied or obvious to the speaker. Therefore, the utterance is bona fide.

**Conclusion**: The primary communicative act is **Inquire**, as the speaker is directly asking for information to understand a situation. There are no strong politeness markers, and it is a sincere (bona fide) question.

There was a time when a player ""had the thing"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.",,Original post,Claim,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player ""had the thing"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you."" This is the final part of the original poster's (OP's) initial message, where they lay out a problem they're having with friends in multiplayer games. The OP feels their friends' reaction to their faster progression is illogical and discouraging.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to express their personal state of mind and their opinion on the matter. The phrase ""I do not understand"" is a direct statement about their internal, subjective state. The second sentence contrasts a past, idealized gaming culture with the current behavior they are observing. This entire statement serves to assert the speaker's personal viewpoint and feelings of confusion and frustration.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Claim**: This is the strongest candidate. A `Claim` is a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, often describing a state of mind, feeling, or belief. ""I do not understand..."" is a classic example of a claim about one's own mental state. The following statement about how things ""used to be"" is also presented as the speaker's personal belief or opinion about a cultural norm, not as a hard, verifiable fact. The entire utterance is an expression of the speaker's opinion.
    *   **Inform**: This is less likely. While the second sentence has the structure of an informational statement (""There was a time when...""), its function in this context is to support the speaker's subjective claim of not understanding. It's a generalized, nostalgic observation rather than a piece of verifiable, factual information. The primary function is not to inform but to opine.
    *   **Elaborate**: The utterance does summarize and generalize the problem described in the preceding examples (Terraria, Pax Dei). In that sense, it elaborates on the OP's overall point. However, the definition of `Elaborate` is to ""comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance."" This utterance functions more as a concluding statement of opinion for the entire post rather than a direct elaboration on the immediately preceding sentence. `Claim` better captures the core communicative function of asserting a personal, subjective viewpoint. Given that the utterance is primarily about the speaker's internal state and belief, `Claim` is the more precise label.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance expresses frustration but is not directed at a specific addressee in an impolite manner. It critiques a ""mentality"" in general. It lacks any specific politeness or impoliteness markers. Therefore, it is neutral.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance is not reporting what someone else said. It's the speaker's own thoughts.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in their confusion and frustration. There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is `Claim`, as the speaker is asserting their subjective feelings and beliefs.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player ""had the thing"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you."" This is the final part of the original poster's (OP's) initial message, where they lay out a problem they're having with friends in multiplayer games. The OP feels their friends' reaction to their faster progression is illogical and discouraging.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to express their personal state of mind and their opinion on the matter. The phrase ""I do not understand"" is a direct statement about their internal, subjective state. The second sentence contrasts a past, idealized gaming culture with the current behavior they are observing. This entire statement serves to assert the speaker's personal viewpoint and feelings of confusion and frustration.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Claim**: This is the strongest candidate. A `Claim` is a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, often describing a state of mind, feeling, or belief. ""I do not understand..."" is a classic example of a claim about one's own mental state. The following statement about how things ""used to be"" is also presented as the speaker's personal belief or opinion about a cultural norm, not as a hard, verifiable fact. The entire utterance is an expression of the speaker's opinion.
    *   **Inform**: This is less likely. While the second sentence has the structure of an informational statement (""There was a time when...""), its function in this context is to support the speaker's subjective claim of not understanding. It's a generalized, nostalgic observation rather than a piece of verifiable, factual information. The primary function is not to inform but to opine.
    *   **Elaborate**: The utterance does summarize and generalize the problem described in the preceding examples (Terraria, Pax Dei). In that sense, it elaborates on the OP's overall point. However, the definition of `Elaborate` is to ""comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance."" This utterance functions more as a concluding statement of opinion for the entire post rather than a direct elaboration on the immediately preceding sentence. `Claim` better captures the core communicative function of asserting a personal, subjective viewpoint. Given that the utterance is primarily about the speaker's internal state and belief, `Claim` is the more precise label.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance expresses frustration but is not directed at a specific addressee in an impolite manner. It critiques a ""mentality"" in general. It lacks any specific politeness or impoliteness markers. Therefore, it is neutral.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance is not reporting what someone else said. It's the speaker's own thoughts.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in their confusion and frustration. There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is `Claim`, as the speaker is asserting their subjective feelings and beliefs.

6,1,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,Did you ask your friends? ,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Inquire,,non-bona fide,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""Did you ask your friends?"". It is a direct response to the original poster (OP), who wrote a long post speculating about why their friends stopped playing a game with them and asking the Reddit community for answers. The OP never mentions having discussed the issue with the friends directly.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The utterance is grammatically a question. However, its primary purpose in this context is not simply to gather information (the speaker likely assumes the answer is ""no""). Instead, the question serves to point out a more direct way for the OP to get the answer they are seeking. It functions as a suggestion or a piece of advice, implying ""You should ask your friends about this instead of asking us."" This makes it a rhetorical question.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inquire**: This matches the surface form of the utterance, as it is a question seeking information. The definition also includes ""marked proposals,"" which could apply here, as the question proposes a course of action.
    *   **Invite**: This captures the underlying intent of *suggesting* a course of action (""What if you asked your friends?"").
    *   **Direct**: This captures the function of *advising* the OP on how to handle the situation (""You should ask your friends."").

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is phrased neutrally. It does not contain any specific politeness markers, nor is it impolite. Therefore, no politeness code is assigned.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**: The question is not a bona fide, sincere request for information. It's a rhetorical question intended to make a point. The speaker doesn't expect to learn something new but uses the question form to guide the OP's thinking. This fits the definition of **[non-bona fide]** communication. The instructions for non-bona fide acts state to ""code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code."" The sincere, surface-level act is a question. Therefore, the correct base act is **Inquire**. The meta-act **[non-bona fide]** is added to capture its rhetorical nature. This combination accurately reflects that the utterance has the form of a question but the intent of a suggestion or piece of advice.

6.  **Final Decision**: The primary act is **Inquire**, based on the surface form, and the meta-act is **[non-bona fide]** to reflect its rhetorical function.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""Did you ask your friends?"". It is a direct response to the original poster (OP), who wrote a long post speculating about why their friends stopped playing a game with them and asking the Reddit community for answers. The OP never mentions having discussed the issue with the friends directly.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The utterance is grammatically a question. However, its primary purpose in this context is not simply to gather information (the speaker likely assumes the answer is ""no""). Instead, the question serves to point out a more direct way for the OP to get the answer they are seeking. It functions as a suggestion or a piece of advice, implying ""You should ask your friends about this instead of asking us."" This makes it a rhetorical question.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Inquire**: This matches the surface form of the utterance, as it is a question seeking information. The definition also includes ""marked proposals,"" which could apply here, as the question proposes a course of action.
    *   **Invite**: This captures the underlying intent of *suggesting* a course of action (""What if you asked your friends?"").
    *   **Direct**: This captures the function of *advising* the OP on how to handle the situation (""You should ask your friends."").

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is phrased neutrally. It does not contain any specific politeness markers, nor is it impolite. Therefore, no politeness code is assigned.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**: The question is not a bona fide, sincere request for information. It's a rhetorical question intended to make a point. The speaker doesn't expect to learn something new but uses the question form to guide the OP's thinking. This fits the definition of **[non-bona fide]** communication. The instructions for non-bona fide acts state to ""code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code."" The sincere, surface-level act is a question. Therefore, the correct base act is **Inquire**. The meta-act **[non-bona fide]** is added to capture its rhetorical nature. This combination accurately reflects that the utterance has the form of a question but the intent of a suggestion or piece of advice.

6.  **Final Decision**: The primary act is **Inquire**, based on the surface form, and the meta-act is **[non-bona fide]** to reflect its rhetorical function.

7,1,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,They'd be the ones with the answer.,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Direct,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They'd be the ones with the answer."" It is a direct reply to the original poster (OP), CallSign_Fjor. The OP's post is a series of questions asking for an explanation of their friends' behavior (""What's up with people...?"", ""why wouldn't you want...?"", ""Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?""). The OP is seeking an answer from the Reddit community.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is responding to the OP's request for an explanation. By stating ""They'd be the ones with the answer,"" the speaker is pointing out that the only people who truly know why the friends are upset are the friends themselves. The intent is not merely to state a fact, but to guide the OP toward the correct source for the information they seek. It implicitly suggests that the OP should ask their friends directly, rather than asking strangers on Reddit. This is a form of guidance or advice.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Direct**: This seems like the strongest candidate. The definition includes ""advise."" The utterance is advising the OP on how to find the answer they are looking for. It functions as an indirect directive: ""(You should ask them because) they'd be the ones with the answer.""
    *   **Inform**: The utterance does provide information—that the friends hold the answer. This is a verifiable fact within the context of the situation. However, the primary *function* of this information is to direct the OP's course of action. The informative aspect serves the advisory purpose, making `Direct` the more primary and fitting act.
    *   **Reject**: One could argue it rejects the OP's question to the Reddit community, implying ""You're asking the wrong people."" However, the tone is not one of disagreement or challenge, but of helpful redirection. It doesn't dispute the OP's problem, but rather the method of finding a solution. Therefore, `Direct` is more precise than `Reject`.

    Comparing these, `Direct` best captures the primary communicative goal of advising the OP.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is stated neutrally. It doesn't contain any markers of positive or negative politeness, nor is it impolite. It's a straightforward, logical piece of advice. Therefore, no politeness code is warranted.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is not reported speech. It is a sincere, bona fide statement. There is no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical intent. Therefore, no meta-act is applicable.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is `Direct`.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They'd be the ones with the answer."" It is a direct reply to the original poster (OP), CallSign_Fjor. The OP's post is a series of questions asking for an explanation of their friends' behavior (""What's up with people...?"", ""why wouldn't you want...?"", ""Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?""). The OP is seeking an answer from the Reddit community.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is responding to the OP's request for an explanation. By stating ""They'd be the ones with the answer,"" the speaker is pointing out that the only people who truly know why the friends are upset are the friends themselves. The intent is not merely to state a fact, but to guide the OP toward the correct source for the information they seek. It implicitly suggests that the OP should ask their friends directly, rather than asking strangers on Reddit. This is a form of guidance or advice.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Direct**: This seems like the strongest candidate. The definition includes ""advise."" The utterance is advising the OP on how to find the answer they are looking for. It functions as an indirect directive: ""(You should ask them because) they'd be the ones with the answer.""
    *   **Inform**: The utterance does provide information—that the friends hold the answer. This is a verifiable fact within the context of the situation. However, the primary *function* of this information is to direct the OP's course of action. The informative aspect serves the advisory purpose, making `Direct` the more primary and fitting act.
    *   **Reject**: One could argue it rejects the OP's question to the Reddit community, implying ""You're asking the wrong people."" However, the tone is not one of disagreement or challenge, but of helpful redirection. It doesn't dispute the OP's problem, but rather the method of finding a solution. Therefore, `Direct` is more precise than `Reject`.

    Comparing these, `Direct` best captures the primary communicative goal of advising the OP.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is stated neutrally. It doesn't contain any markers of positive or negative politeness, nor is it impolite. It's a straightforward, logical piece of advice. Therefore, no politeness code is warranted.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is not reported speech. It is a sincere, bona fide statement. There is no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical intent. Therefore, no meta-act is applicable.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is `Direct`.

8,1,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,"As someone not involved, it sounds like they wanted to play and discover the game together. Knowing you had already gone through everything and now were just kinda babysitting them probably took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable. ",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Claim,+N,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is, ""As someone not involved, it sounds like they wanted to play and discover the game together. Knowing you had already gone through everything and now were just kinda babysitting them probably took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable."" The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is responding to the original poster (OP), who expressed confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing a game after the OP progressed far ahead on their own. The utterance aims to provide an explanation for the friends' behavior from an outsider's perspective.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to offer a potential explanation for the friends' actions. The OP asked ""I don't get it, why...?"" The speaker is answering this question by speculating on the friends' internal state—their desires and feelings. The use of phrases like ""As someone not involved,"" ""it sounds like,"" and ""probably"" clearly marks the utterance as a subjective interpretation or opinion rather than a statement of fact.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Claim**: This is the strongest candidate. A Claim is a ""subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate."" The speaker is doing exactly this: speculating about the friends' desire (""they wanted to play and discover the game together"") and their feelings (""took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable""). The entire utterance functions as the speaker's opinion on the situation.
    *   **Inform**: This is less appropriate because the information is not ""verifiable in principle."" The speaker, being ""not involved,"" has no direct access to the friends' true feelings and is presenting an inference, not a fact.
    *   **Desire [reported]**: One could argue that the core of the explanation is the friends' reported desire (""they wanted to play...""). However, ""Claim"" is a better fit for the entire utterance, which also includes an assertion about their feelings (""made it less enjoyable""). Furthermore, the framing ""it sounds like"" presents the whole statement as the speaker's own inference and opinion, making the primary act the speaker's act of claiming, rather than simply reporting the friends' desire.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is framed very carefully to avoid being confrontational. The speaker uses several hedging strategies, which are characteristic of negative politeness.
    *   ""As someone not involved"" distances the speaker and frames the comment as an objective observation.
    *   ""it sounds like"" and ""probably"" soften the assertion, presenting it as a possibility rather than a hard fact.
    *   This hedging respects the addressee's (OP's) autonomy and avoids imposing an unwelcome truth, fitting the definition of **+N** (Negative politeness).

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: As discussed above, while the utterance talks about the friends' mental state, the primary act is the speaker's own act of opining or claiming about that state, not reporting a speech act from the friends. Therefore, it is not a reported act.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The utterance appears to be a sincere attempt to help the OP understand the situation. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is **Claim**, as the speaker is offering a subjective speculation on the friends' motivations. The politeness is **+N** due to the extensive use of hedging to soften the explanation. There are no meta-acts.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is, ""As someone not involved, it sounds like they wanted to play and discover the game together. Knowing you had already gone through everything and now were just kinda babysitting them probably took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable."" The speaker, AurelianoTampa, is responding to the original poster (OP), who expressed confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing a game after the OP progressed far ahead on their own. The utterance aims to provide an explanation for the friends' behavior from an outsider's perspective.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to offer a potential explanation for the friends' actions. The OP asked ""I don't get it, why...?"" The speaker is answering this question by speculating on the friends' internal state—their desires and feelings. The use of phrases like ""As someone not involved,"" ""it sounds like,"" and ""probably"" clearly marks the utterance as a subjective interpretation or opinion rather than a statement of fact.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
    *   **Claim**: This is the strongest candidate. A Claim is a ""subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate."" The speaker is doing exactly this: speculating about the friends' desire (""they wanted to play and discover the game together"") and their feelings (""took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable""). The entire utterance functions as the speaker's opinion on the situation.
    *   **Inform**: This is less appropriate because the information is not ""verifiable in principle."" The speaker, being ""not involved,"" has no direct access to the friends' true feelings and is presenting an inference, not a fact.
    *   **Desire [reported]**: One could argue that the core of the explanation is the friends' reported desire (""they wanted to play...""). However, ""Claim"" is a better fit for the entire utterance, which also includes an assertion about their feelings (""made it less enjoyable""). Furthermore, the framing ""it sounds like"" presents the whole statement as the speaker's own inference and opinion, making the primary act the speaker's act of claiming, rather than simply reporting the friends' desire.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is framed very carefully to avoid being confrontational. The speaker uses several hedging strategies, which are characteristic of negative politeness.
    *   ""As someone not involved"" distances the speaker and frames the comment as an objective observation.
    *   ""it sounds like"" and ""probably"" soften the assertion, presenting it as a possibility rather than a hard fact.
    *   This hedging respects the addressee's (OP's) autonomy and avoids imposing an unwelcome truth, fitting the definition of **+N** (Negative politeness).

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: As discussed above, while the utterance talks about the friends' mental state, the primary act is the speaker's own act of opining or claiming about that state, not reporting a speech act from the friends. Therefore, it is not a reported act.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The utterance appears to be a sincere attempt to help the OP understand the situation. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is **Claim**, as the speaker is offering a subjective speculation on the friends' motivations. The politeness is **+N** due to the extensive use of hedging to soften the explanation. There are no meta-acts.

8,2,,,AurelianoTampa,,"They wanted a new experience as a group, ",CallSign_Fjor,,Claim,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They wanted a new experience as a group,"". The speaker (AurelianoTampa) is an uninvolved third party explaining to the original poster (OP) why the OP's friends might have lost interest in playing a game together. The speaker prefaces their explanation with phrases like ""it sounds like"" and ""Guessing it's..."", indicating that they are offering a speculative interpretation of the friends' feelings and motivations.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's goal is to present their opinion or hypothesis about the friends' internal state (their desire) to help the OP understand the situation from a different perspective. The speaker is not stating a known fact, but rather making a subjective assertion about what the friends were feeling.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Claim**: This act is defined as making a ""subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief"". This fits the utterance perfectly. The speaker is asserting their belief about the friends' state of mind (""they wanted...""). This is an opinion, not a verifiable fact, which is reinforced by the speculative framing in the surrounding text.
    *   **Desire [reported]**: This is a possibility because the content of the utterance is about a desire (""wanted""). However, the `[reported]` meta-act typically applies when the speaker is reporting something someone else said or explicitly communicated (e.g., ""She said she wants to go""). In this case, the speaker is not reporting a communicated desire but is inferring it and presenting it as their own assertion or opinion. The primary communicative act is the speaker's own act of opining, not the act of reporting. Therefore, Claim is a better fit for the speaker's action.
    *   **Inform**: This is inappropriate because the information (the friends' desire) is not verifiable in principle, especially by an uninvolved third party. It is speculation, not a statement of fact.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The overall message from the speaker is framed politely, using hedging (""it sounds like"") which could be seen as Negative Politeness (+N) as it softens the potential disagreement with the OP. However, the target utterance ""They wanted a new experience as a group,"" when analyzed in isolation, is a neutral statement. It does not contain any explicit politeness markers itself. Following the guideline to annotate only when a clear politeness act is present in the utterance, I will not assign a politeness code.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: As discussed above, this is not a report of a communicated act but rather the speaker's own assertion about a third party's mental state. So, `[reported]` is not applicable.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in offering their perspective. The utterance is not sarcastic, ironic, or a joke.

**Conclusion**: The most appropriate label is **Claim**. The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the friends' state of mind to explain their behavior. This assertion is unverifiable and constitutes the speaker's opinion on the matter.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""They wanted a new experience as a group,"". The speaker (AurelianoTampa) is an uninvolved third party explaining to the original poster (OP) why the OP's friends might have lost interest in playing a game together. The speaker prefaces their explanation with phrases like ""it sounds like"" and ""Guessing it's..."", indicating that they are offering a speculative interpretation of the friends' feelings and motivations.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's goal is to present their opinion or hypothesis about the friends' internal state (their desire) to help the OP understand the situation from a different perspective. The speaker is not stating a known fact, but rather making a subjective assertion about what the friends were feeling.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Claim**: This act is defined as making a ""subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief"". This fits the utterance perfectly. The speaker is asserting their belief about the friends' state of mind (""they wanted...""). This is an opinion, not a verifiable fact, which is reinforced by the speculative framing in the surrounding text.
    *   **Desire [reported]**: This is a possibility because the content of the utterance is about a desire (""wanted""). However, the `[reported]` meta-act typically applies when the speaker is reporting something someone else said or explicitly communicated (e.g., ""She said she wants to go""). In this case, the speaker is not reporting a communicated desire but is inferring it and presenting it as their own assertion or opinion. The primary communicative act is the speaker's own act of opining, not the act of reporting. Therefore, Claim is a better fit for the speaker's action.
    *   **Inform**: This is inappropriate because the information (the friends' desire) is not verifiable in principle, especially by an uninvolved third party. It is speculation, not a statement of fact.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The overall message from the speaker is framed politely, using hedging (""it sounds like"") which could be seen as Negative Politeness (+N) as it softens the potential disagreement with the OP. However, the target utterance ""They wanted a new experience as a group,"" when analyzed in isolation, is a neutral statement. It does not contain any explicit politeness markers itself. Following the guideline to annotate only when a clear politeness act is present in the utterance, I will not assign a politeness code.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: As discussed above, this is not a report of a communicated act but rather the speaker's own assertion about a third party's mental state. So, `[reported]` is not applicable.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in offering their perspective. The utterance is not sarcastic, ironic, or a joke.

**Conclusion**: The most appropriate label is **Claim**. The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the friends' state of mind to explain their behavior. This assertion is unverifiable and constitutes the speaker's opinion on the matter.

8,3,,,AurelianoTampa,,and you went and had the experience on your own. ,CallSign_Fjor,,Elaborate,,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""and you went and had the experience on your own."" It is spoken by AurelianoTampa to CallSign_Fjor (the OP). The OP is confused about why their friends stopped playing a game with them after the OP played ahead and finished it alone. AurelianoTampa's entire message is an attempt to explain the friends' perspective to the OP. The target utterance is the conclusion of the sentence: ""They wanted a new experience as a group, and you went and had the experience on your own.""

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is not simply stating a fact that the OP already knows (that they played the game alone). Instead, the speaker is using this fact to explain the discrepancy between what the friends wanted (a shared group experience) and what the OP did (had a solo experience). The primary intent is to explain and clarify the source of the conflict from the friends' point of view.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Elaborate**: This act is defined as ""Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance."" The target utterance directly follows and contrasts with the first part of the sentence, ""They wanted a new experience as a group..."". By stating what the OP did, it explains *why* the friends' desire was unfulfilled and why they were likely upset. This fits the definition and context of providing an explanation.
    *   **Inform**: This act is defined as providing ""factual"" information. The statement that the OP ""went and had the experience on your own"" is factually true, as the OP stated it themselves. However, the primary function here is not to convey new information but to use existing information as part of an explanation. The communicative goal is explanatory, not informational.
    *   **Claim**: This is less likely because the utterance states a verifiable fact about the OP's actions, not a subjective or unverifiable belief.

    Comparing `Elaborate` and `Inform`, `Elaborate` better captures the primary function. The utterance serves to explain the preceding clause and the overall situation. It is the explanatory core of the speaker's argument.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is presented in a neutral, explanatory tone. It is a direct statement of fact used in an argument. It does not contain positive politeness markers (like praise or solidarity) or negative politeness markers (like hedging or apologies). It is also not impolite; it is not an attack or an imposition. Therefore, it is neutral and no politeness code is assigned.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The speaker is not reporting what someone else said. They are making a direct statement to the addressee about the addressee's own actions.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The statement is sincere. There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is **Elaborate**.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""and you went and had the experience on your own."" It is spoken by AurelianoTampa to CallSign_Fjor (the OP). The OP is confused about why their friends stopped playing a game with them after the OP played ahead and finished it alone. AurelianoTampa's entire message is an attempt to explain the friends' perspective to the OP. The target utterance is the conclusion of the sentence: ""They wanted a new experience as a group, and you went and had the experience on your own.""

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is not simply stating a fact that the OP already knows (that they played the game alone). Instead, the speaker is using this fact to explain the discrepancy between what the friends wanted (a shared group experience) and what the OP did (had a solo experience). The primary intent is to explain and clarify the source of the conflict from the friends' point of view.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Elaborate**: This act is defined as ""Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance."" The target utterance directly follows and contrasts with the first part of the sentence, ""They wanted a new experience as a group..."". By stating what the OP did, it explains *why* the friends' desire was unfulfilled and why they were likely upset. This fits the definition and context of providing an explanation.
    *   **Inform**: This act is defined as providing ""factual"" information. The statement that the OP ""went and had the experience on your own"" is factually true, as the OP stated it themselves. However, the primary function here is not to convey new information but to use existing information as part of an explanation. The communicative goal is explanatory, not informational.
    *   **Claim**: This is less likely because the utterance states a verifiable fact about the OP's actions, not a subjective or unverifiable belief.

    Comparing `Elaborate` and `Inform`, `Elaborate` better captures the primary function. The utterance serves to explain the preceding clause and the overall situation. It is the explanatory core of the speaker's argument.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is presented in a neutral, explanatory tone. It is a direct statement of fact used in an argument. It does not contain positive politeness markers (like praise or solidarity) or negative politeness markers (like hedging or apologies). It is also not impolite; it is not an attack or an imposition. Therefore, it is neutral and no politeness code is assigned.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The speaker is not reporting what someone else said. They are making a direct statement to the addressee about the addressee's own actions.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The statement is sincere. There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Based on this analysis, the primary communicative act is **Elaborate**.

",CallSign_Fjor,,Elaborate,+N,,"1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance to be annotated is ""Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going ""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!"""". It is part of a larger message where the speaker, AurelianoTampa, is explaining to the original poster (OP) why their friends might have lost interest in playing a game with them. The immediately preceding sentence from AurelianoTampa is: ""They wanted a new experience as a group, and you went and had the experience on your own."" The target utterance follows this statement, aiming to make the point more relatable.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to help the OP understand their friends' perspective. The target utterance achieves this by providing an analogy. It explains the preceding statement by comparing the OP's actions to a friend spoiling a TV show for a group. The intent is explanatory and illustrative.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Elaborate**: This act is defined as ""Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance."" This fits perfectly. The speaker has just made a point (""They wanted a new experience as a group...""), and the target utterance serves to explain and comment on that point by offering a detailed analogy. The analogy clarifies *why* the friends would feel that the experience was spoiled.
    *   **Claim**: This act is defined as making a subjective assertion or opining. The utterance begins with ""Guessing..."", which clearly marks it as a speculation or opinion. The speaker is asserting their belief that the two situations are analogous. This is also a strong candidate.
    *   **Inform**: This is less likely, as the utterance is not presenting verifiable information but a subjective comparison.

    **Decision between Elaborate and Claim**: While the utterance is a subjective claim, its primary function within the speaker's turn is to support and clarify the immediately preceding statement. It's not just a standalone opinion; it's an explanation in the form of an analogy. The taxonomy directs us to choose the primary function. The act of explaining one's own previous point is best captured by **Elaborate**.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The speaker is offering a potentially critical perspective on the OP's behavior. The use of ""Guessing..."" is a hedging strategy. Hedging is a classic negative politeness (+N) technique used to soften a statement and minimize the imposition on the addressee. By framing the explanation as a guess, the speaker respects the OP's autonomy and avoids presenting their interpretation as an absolute fact. Therefore, the utterance exhibits negative politeness. The code is **+N**.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance contains a hypothetical quote (""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!""). However, this quote is embedded within the speaker's own analogy. The main communicative act is the creation of the analogy itself (the elaboration), not the reporting of the speech within it. The reported speech is illustrative, not the core act. Thus, the `[reported]` tag is not appropriate for the entire utterance.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in their attempt to explain the situation. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Therefore, no meta-act is applicable.

**Conclusion**: The primary act is **Elaborate**, as it explains the speaker's preceding point with an analogy. The politeness is **+N** due to the use of hedging (""Guessing...""). There are no meta-acts.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

1.  **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance to be annotated is ""Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going ""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!"""". It is part of a larger message where the speaker, AurelianoTampa, is explaining to the original poster (OP) why their friends might have lost interest in playing a game with them. The immediately preceding sentence from AurelianoTampa is: ""They wanted a new experience as a group, and you went and had the experience on your own."" The target utterance follows this statement, aiming to make the point more relatable.

2.  **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's primary goal is to help the OP understand their friends' perspective. The target utterance achieves this by providing an analogy. It explains the preceding statement by comparing the OP's actions to a friend spoiling a TV show for a group. The intent is explanatory and illustrative.

3.  **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:
    *   **Elaborate**: This act is defined as ""Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance."" This fits perfectly. The speaker has just made a point (""They wanted a new experience as a group...""), and the target utterance serves to explain and comment on that point by offering a detailed analogy. The analogy clarifies *why* the friends would feel that the experience was spoiled.
    *   **Claim**: This act is defined as making a subjective assertion or opining. The utterance begins with ""Guessing..."", which clearly marks it as a speculation or opinion. The speaker is asserting their belief that the two situations are analogous. This is also a strong candidate.
    *   **Inform**: This is less likely, as the utterance is not presenting verifiable information but a subjective comparison.

    **Decision between Elaborate and Claim**: While the utterance is a subjective claim, its primary function within the speaker's turn is to support and clarify the immediately preceding statement. It's not just a standalone opinion; it's an explanation in the form of an analogy. The taxonomy directs us to choose the primary function. The act of explaining one's own previous point is best captured by **Elaborate**.

4.  **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The speaker is offering a potentially critical perspective on the OP's behavior. The use of ""Guessing..."" is a hedging strategy. Hedging is a classic negative politeness (+N) technique used to soften a statement and minimize the imposition on the addressee. By framing the explanation as a guess, the speaker respects the OP's autonomy and avoids presenting their interpretation as an absolute fact. Therefore, the utterance exhibits negative politeness. The code is **+N**.

5.  **Check for meta-acts**:
    *   **[reported]**: The utterance contains a hypothetical quote (""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!""). However, this quote is embedded within the speaker's own analogy. The main communicative act is the creation of the analogy itself (the elaboration), not the reporting of the speech within it. The reported speech is illustrative, not the core act. Thus, the `[reported]` tag is not appropriate for the entire utterance.
    *   **[non-bona fide]**: The speaker is being sincere in their attempt to explain the situation. There is no evidence of sarcasm, irony, or joking.

Therefore, no meta-act is applicable.

**Conclusion**: The primary act is **Elaborate**, as it explains the speaker's preceding point with an analogy. The politeness is **+N** due to the use of hedging (""Guessing...""). There are no meta-acts.
