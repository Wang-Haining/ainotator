1,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,Inquire,,,"Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"" is the opening line of a Reddit post where CallSign_Fjor is asking about a gaming phenomenon they've experienced multiple times. The context shows this is a genuine question seeking understanding about other players' behavior.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is genuinely seeking information/explanation about why some players lose interest in games when others have progressed further. This is not rhetorical - they provide specific examples and express genuine confusion about this behavior pattern.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INQUIRE**: This is a direct question seeking information about other people's motivations and behavior. The speaker wants to understand a phenomenon they've observed.
   - **CLAIM**: Could be interpreted as making a subjective assertion about people's behavior, but the question form and context suggest genuine information-seeking.
   - **MANAGE**: Could be seen as opening a discussion topic, but the primary function is seeking information rather than organizing discourse.

The question form (""What's up with..."") and the context of providing examples and expressing confusion strongly indicate this is a genuine inquiry seeking information/explanation.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutrally worded without clear positive or negative politeness markers. It's a straightforward question without hedging, aggression, or particular deference.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This appears to be bona fide communication - the speaker is genuinely asking for understanding. There's no sarcasm, irony, or reported speech present.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges.

2,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). ,,Original post,Inform,,,"Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is describing a specific gaming experience with Terraria where they played ahead of their friends in single-player mode, then returned to the group game. They're providing factual details about what happened - they started single-player because friends were slow, finished the game, then rejoined using only appropriate gear and sharing resources.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing background information to support their broader question about why friends lose interest when someone progresses further. This is part of setting up the context for their main inquiry about this gaming phenomenon. They're recounting events that actually happened to illustrate their point.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual, verifiable information about what they did in the game - they started single-player, finished it, used appropriate gear, shared summons, etc. This information can be verified in principle.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as expanding on their opening question by providing a concrete example.
   - **CLAIM**: This could be viewed as a subjective account of their experience.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral in tone. There's no clear positive or negative politeness markers - it's a straightforward recounting of events without hedging, compliments, or face-threatening acts.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is not reported speech (the speaker is describing their own actions, not quoting someone else). It's also not non-bona fide - there's no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical elements. This appears to be a sincere, factual account.

The primary function is INFORM because the speaker is providing factual information about specific gaming events that could be verified in principle (game progression, gear usage, resource sharing). While this supports their broader argument, the immediate communicative goal of this particular utterance is to inform the audience about what actually happened in their gaming session.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is describing a specific gaming experience with Terraria where they played ahead of their friends in single-player mode, then returned to the group game. They're providing factual details about what happened - they started single-player because friends were slow, finished the game, then rejoined using only appropriate gear and sharing resources.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing background information to support their broader question about why friends lose interest when someone progresses further. This is part of setting up the context for their main inquiry about this gaming phenomenon. They're recounting events that actually happened to illustrate their point.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual, verifiable information about what they did in the game - they started single-player, finished it, used appropriate gear, shared summons, etc. This information can be verified in principle.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as expanding on their opening question by providing a concrete example.
   - **CLAIM**: This could be viewed as a subjective account of their experience.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral in tone. There's no clear positive or negative politeness markers - it's a straightforward recounting of events without hedging, compliments, or face-threatening acts.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is not reported speech (the speaker is describing their own actions, not quoting someone else). It's also not non-bona fide - there's no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical elements. This appears to be a sincere, factual account.

The primary function is INFORM because the speaker is providing factual information about specific gaming events that could be verified in principle (game progression, gear usage, resource sharing). While this supports their broader argument, the immediate communicative goal of this particular utterance is to inform the audience about what actually happened in their gaming session.

2,2,,,CallSign_Fjor,,"When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. ",,,Inform,,,"Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" is part of CallSign_Fjor's explanation of what happened with their gaming group. This is within a longer narrative where they're describing the sequence of events that led to their friends losing interest in continuing the game together.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about what happened when they disclosed their single-player progress to their friends. They're reporting on the friends' reaction and subsequent behavior. This appears to be straightforward factual reporting of events that occurred.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: This seems most likely - the speaker is providing verifiable factual information about what happened (they told their friends something, and the friends reacted in a specific way and haven't returned for a week).
   - **CLAIM**: Could be possible if this were more subjective or unverifiable, but the speaker is reporting observable behaviors and events.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be considered since it's expanding on the previous context, but the primary function seems to be informing about what happened rather than just elaborating on a previous point.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance appears neutral in tone. There's no clear positive or negative politeness markers, insults, condescension, or other strong politeness/impoliteness indicators. It's a straightforward factual report.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This doesn't appear to be reported speech in the technical sense (the speaker isn't quoting what someone else said), nor does it seem sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-bona fide. It's a sincere account of events.

The primary function is clearly INFORM - the speaker is providing factual information about a sequence of events that can be verified in principle (they told their friends something, the friends reacted negatively, and they haven't returned for a week).","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" is part of CallSign_Fjor's explanation of what happened with their gaming group. This is within a longer narrative where they're describing the sequence of events that led to their friends losing interest in continuing the game together.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about what happened when they disclosed their single-player progress to their friends. They're reporting on the friends' reaction and subsequent behavior. This appears to be straightforward factual reporting of events that occurred.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: This seems most likely - the speaker is providing verifiable factual information about what happened (they told their friends something, and the friends reacted in a specific way and haven't returned for a week).
   - **CLAIM**: Could be possible if this were more subjective or unverifiable, but the speaker is reporting observable behaviors and events.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be considered since it's expanding on the previous context, but the primary function seems to be informing about what happened rather than just elaborating on a previous point.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance appears neutral in tone. There's no clear positive or negative politeness markers, insults, condescension, or other strong politeness/impoliteness indicators. It's a straightforward factual report.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This doesn't appear to be reported speech in the technical sense (the speaker isn't quoting what someone else said), nor does it seem sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-bona fide. It's a sincere account of events.

The primary function is clearly INFORM - the speaker is providing factual information about a sequence of events that can be verified in principle (they told their friends something, the friends reacted negatively, and they haven't returned for a week).

2,3,,,CallSign_Fjor,,It's been a week ,,,Inform,,,"Let me analyze the target utterance ""It's been a week"" step by step:

1. **Reading in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is explaining a situation where their friends lost interest in playing Terraria together after learning that the speaker had already completed the game solo. The utterance ""It's been a week"" comes right after explaining that three friends ""were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on"" and before stating ""their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.""

2. **Identifying primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about the duration of time that has passed since their friends stopped playing. This serves to emphasize how long the friends have been absent and adds weight to their concern about the situation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is stating a verifiable fact about time elapsed - ""It's been a week"" provides concrete temporal information about when the friends stopped playing.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as commenting on or explaining the previous statement about friends not joining back on, providing additional detail about the duration.
   - **CLAIM**: This could be a subjective assertion about the significance of the time period, but it's more factual than subjective.

The primary function appears to be INFORM - the speaker is providing factual, verifiable information about the time that has elapsed since the friends stopped playing.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral and factual. There's no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness strategies. It's simply stating a temporal fact.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is straightforward factual reporting, not reported speech from someone else, and there's no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical nature to the statement. It's bona fide communication.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Let me analyze the target utterance ""It's been a week"" step by step:

1. **Reading in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is explaining a situation where their friends lost interest in playing Terraria together after learning that the speaker had already completed the game solo. The utterance ""It's been a week"" comes right after explaining that three friends ""were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on"" and before stating ""their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.""

2. **Identifying primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about the duration of time that has passed since their friends stopped playing. This serves to emphasize how long the friends have been absent and adds weight to their concern about the situation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is stating a verifiable fact about time elapsed - ""It's been a week"" provides concrete temporal information about when the friends stopped playing.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as commenting on or explaining the previous statement about friends not joining back on, providing additional detail about the duration.
   - **CLAIM**: This could be a subjective assertion about the significance of the time period, but it's more factual than subjective.

The primary function appears to be INFORM - the speaker is providing factual, verifiable information about the time that has elapsed since the friends stopped playing.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral and factual. There's no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness strategies. It's simply stating a temporal fact.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is straightforward factual reporting, not reported speech from someone else, and there's no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical nature to the statement. It's bona fide communication.

2,4,,,CallSign_Fjor,,and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.,,,Inform,,reported,"Let me analyze the target utterance ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game"" step by step:

1. **Reading in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is explaining why their friends stopped playing Terraria with them. The friends discovered that CallSign_Fjor had already completed the game in single-player mode, and now they've lost interest in continuing their multiplayer session. This utterance is part of CallSign_Fjor's narrative explaining the situation.

2. **Identifying primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friends said/their reasoning for quitting. This is reporting what the friends told them as an explanation for their behavior. The word ""excuse"" suggests the speaker may view this reasoning as inadequate or dismissive, but they're still conveying the friends' stated rationale.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friends said - reporting their stated reason for not wanting to continue playing
   - **CLAIM**: Could be seen as the speaker's subjective assertion/opinion about their friends' reasoning (especially with the word ""excuse"" which carries evaluative connotation)
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as expanding on the previous statement about friends being ""immediately uninterested""

The structure ""their excuse is that..."" is clearly reporting what the friends said or communicated as their reason. Even though ""excuse"" has a slightly dismissive connotation, the primary function is informational - telling the reader what the friends' stated reasoning was.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The word ""excuse"" carries a mildly dismissive tone, suggesting the speaker doesn't find their friends' reasoning entirely valid. However, this isn't strong enough to constitute clear impoliteness, and it's not directed at the Reddit audience but rather describes the friends' behavior.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is reported speech - the speaker is conveying what their friends said/communicated as their reason. The friends' stated reason is being reported indirectly through paraphrase rather than direct quotation.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C.

It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Let me analyze the target utterance ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game"" step by step:

1. **Reading in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is explaining why their friends stopped playing Terraria with them. The friends discovered that CallSign_Fjor had already completed the game in single-player mode, and now they've lost interest in continuing their multiplayer session. This utterance is part of CallSign_Fjor's narrative explaining the situation.

2. **Identifying primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friends said/their reasoning for quitting. This is reporting what the friends told them as an explanation for their behavior. The word ""excuse"" suggests the speaker may view this reasoning as inadequate or dismissive, but they're still conveying the friends' stated rationale.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friends said - reporting their stated reason for not wanting to continue playing
   - **CLAIM**: Could be seen as the speaker's subjective assertion/opinion about their friends' reasoning (especially with the word ""excuse"" which carries evaluative connotation)
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as expanding on the previous statement about friends being ""immediately uninterested""

The structure ""their excuse is that..."" is clearly reporting what the friends said or communicated as their reason. Even though ""excuse"" has a slightly dismissive connotation, the primary function is informational - telling the reader what the friends' stated reasoning was.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The word ""excuse"" carries a mildly dismissive tone, suggesting the speaker doesn't find their friends' reasoning entirely valid. However, this isn't strong enough to constitute clear impoliteness, and it's not directed at the Reddit audience but rather describes the friends' behavior.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is reported speech - the speaker is conveying what their friends said/communicated as their reason. The friends' stated reason is being reported indirectly through paraphrase rather than direct quotation.

3,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.,,Original post,Inform,,,"Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is saying ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources."" This comes after they described a similar situation with Terraria friends, and they're building a pattern of examples to support their confusion about why friends get discouraged by their progression.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about a past gaming experience to illustrate their point. They're recounting a specific incident that happened in another game (Pax Dei) where a similar dynamic occurred - a friend quit because the speaker had progressed further and was sharing resources.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual information about a verifiable past event - they're reporting what happened in a previous gaming session
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as commenting on or explaining their previous statement about this being a recurring pattern
   - **CLAIM**: This could be a subjective assertion, but the content is more factual reporting of events

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral in tone - the speaker is simply recounting facts without any clear politeness or impoliteness markers. They're not attacking anyone or being particularly deferential.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is not reported speech (the speaker is directly recounting their own experience, not quoting someone else). It's also not non-bona fide - there's no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical questioning here. It's a straightforward factual account.

The primary function is INFORM - the speaker is providing verifiable factual information about a past gaming experience to support their broader point about a pattern they've observed. While it does elaborate on their previous statement, the dominant function is informational rather than explanatory.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is saying ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources."" This comes after they described a similar situation with Terraria friends, and they're building a pattern of examples to support their confusion about why friends get discouraged by their progression.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about a past gaming experience to illustrate their point. They're recounting a specific incident that happened in another game (Pax Dei) where a similar dynamic occurred - a friend quit because the speaker had progressed further and was sharing resources.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual information about a verifiable past event - they're reporting what happened in a previous gaming session
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as commenting on or explaining their previous statement about this being a recurring pattern
   - **CLAIM**: This could be a subjective assertion, but the content is more factual reporting of events

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance is neutral in tone - the speaker is simply recounting facts without any clear politeness or impoliteness markers. They're not attacking anyone or being particularly deferential.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is not reported speech (the speaker is directly recounting their own experience, not quoting someone else). It's also not non-bona fide - there's no sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical questioning here. It's a straightforward factual account.

The primary function is INFORM - the speaker is providing verifiable factual information about a past gaming experience to support their broader point about a pattern they've observed. While it does elaborate on their previous statement, the dominant function is informational rather than explanatory.

3,2,,,CallSign_Fjor,,Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,,Inform,,reported,"Let me analyze the target utterance ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" step by step:

1. **Reading the utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is explaining a past situation where they were mining in a game called Pax Dei and giving resources to a friend who wanted to be a blacksmith. The friend quit because of this, and now the speaker is reporting what the friend's position/reasoning was for quitting.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friend's perspective was. They are reporting/paraphrasing what the friend communicated to them about why they quit the game. This is informational content that helps explain the situation to the Reddit audience.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual information about what happened - specifically, what their friend's stance/position was. This seems most likely.
   - **CLAIM**: Could be seen as making a subjective assertion about the friend's mental state/feelings, but it's more about reporting what was communicated.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as explaining/commenting on the previous statement about the friend quitting, but it's more straightforward information provision.

The primary function appears to be INFORM - the speaker is stating factual information about what their friend's position was.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: This utterance is neutral in tone. There's no clear positive or negative politeness markers, no hedging, no face-threatening acts, no compliments or insults. It's a straightforward informational statement.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is clearly reported speech. The speaker is paraphrasing/reporting what their friend communicated to them (""Their stance was that...""). While not a direct quotation, it's reporting the content of what the friend expressed. This fits the definition of [reported] where the speaker is conveying what someone else said or believed, even if paraphrased rather than directly quoted.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

Let me analyze the target utterance ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" step by step:

1. **Reading the utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is explaining a past situation where they were mining in a game called Pax Dei and giving resources to a friend who wanted to be a blacksmith. The friend quit because of this, and now the speaker is reporting what the friend's position/reasoning was for quitting.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is providing factual information about what their friend's perspective was. They are reporting/paraphrasing what the friend communicated to them about why they quit the game. This is informational content that helps explain the situation to the Reddit audience.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INFORM**: The speaker is providing factual information about what happened - specifically, what their friend's stance/position was. This seems most likely.
   - **CLAIM**: Could be seen as making a subjective assertion about the friend's mental state/feelings, but it's more about reporting what was communicated.
   - **ELABORATE**: This could be seen as explaining/commenting on the previous statement about the friend quitting, but it's more straightforward information provision.

The primary function appears to be INFORM - the speaker is stating factual information about what their friend's position was.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: This utterance is neutral in tone. There's no clear positive or negative politeness markers, no hedging, no face-threatening acts, no compliments or insults. It's a straightforward informational statement.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is clearly reported speech. The speaker is paraphrasing/reporting what their friend communicated to them (""Their stance was that...""). While not a direct quotation, it's reporting the content of what the friend expressed. This fits the definition of [reported] where the speaker is conveying what someone else said or believed, even if paraphrased rather than directly quoted.

4,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,"I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?",,Original post,Inquire,,,"Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is expressing confusion about their friends' behavior. They're asking two related questions: ""I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?"" This comes after describing multiple instances where friends quit games because the speaker had progressed further.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is genuinely seeking to understand their friends' mentality. They're not just asking for information about mining mechanics, but trying to comprehend the psychological/social dynamics at play. The phrase ""I don't get it"" signals genuine confusion and a desire for explanation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The utterance contains direct questions seeking information/explanation about why people behave this way
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be making a subjective assertion about their confusion (""I don't get it"")
   - **Elaborate**: This could be seen as expanding on their previous statements about not understanding this mentality

4. **Evaluating the primary function**: While the utterance starts with ""I don't get it"" (which could be a claim about their mental state), the dominant function is clearly the two direct questions that follow. The speaker is actively seeking understanding and explanation from the community. The ""I don't get it"" serves as a frame for the questions rather than the main communicative goal.

5. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The tone is neutral and genuinely inquisitive. There's no clear politeness or impoliteness markers - it's a straightforward request for understanding.

6. **Checking for meta-acts**: This appears to be bona fide communication - the speaker is genuinely confused and seeking answers. There's no sarcasm, irony, or reported speech present.

The primary communicative function is **Inquire** - the speaker is seeking information and understanding about why people behave this way in gaming contexts.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is expressing confusion about their friends' behavior. They're asking two related questions: ""I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?"" This comes after describing multiple instances where friends quit games because the speaker had progressed further.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is genuinely seeking to understand their friends' mentality. They're not just asking for information about mining mechanics, but trying to comprehend the psychological/social dynamics at play. The phrase ""I don't get it"" signals genuine confusion and a desire for explanation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The utterance contains direct questions seeking information/explanation about why people behave this way
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be making a subjective assertion about their confusion (""I don't get it"")
   - **Elaborate**: This could be seen as expanding on their previous statements about not understanding this mentality

4. **Evaluating the primary function**: While the utterance starts with ""I don't get it"" (which could be a claim about their mental state), the dominant function is clearly the two direct questions that follow. The speaker is actively seeking understanding and explanation from the community. The ""I don't get it"" serves as a frame for the questions rather than the main communicative goal.

5. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The tone is neutral and genuinely inquisitive. There's no clear politeness or impoliteness markers - it's a straightforward request for understanding.

6. **Checking for meta-acts**: This appears to be bona fide communication - the speaker is genuinely confused and seeking answers. There's no sarcasm, irony, or reported speech present.

The primary communicative function is **Inquire** - the speaker is seeking information and understanding about why people behave this way in gaming contexts.

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is expressing confusion about why their friends quit playing games when the speaker had progressed further. The utterance ""I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player 'had the thing' it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you."" comes after they've described multiple instances of friends quitting games due to their progression.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their mental state (""I do not understand"") and expressing their personal belief/opinion about how gaming mentality has changed over time. They're not seeking information (though they are confused), but rather stating their perspective on the situation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **CLAIM**: This fits well because the speaker is making subjective assertions about their understanding (or lack thereof) and expressing beliefs about gaming culture that are unverifiable opinions
   - **INQUIRE**: Less likely, as they're not directly asking a question, though they are expressing confusion
   - **INFORM**: Less likely, as they're not providing factual information but rather personal opinions and subjective states

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance doesn't contain clear politeness or impoliteness markers. It's a neutral expression of the speaker's perspective without attacking or particularly honoring anyone's face.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This appears to be bona fide communication - the speaker is genuinely expressing their confusion and opinion. There's no sarcasm, irony, or reported speech present.

The primary function is expressing the speaker's subjective mental state (""I do not understand"") and their personal beliefs about gaming culture, which aligns with CLAIM as it involves subjective assertions that are unverifiable in principle.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Let me analyze this utterance step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The speaker (CallSign_Fjor) is expressing confusion about why their friends quit playing games when the speaker had progressed further. The utterance ""I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player 'had the thing' it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you."" comes after they've described multiple instances of friends quitting games due to their progression.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their mental state (""I do not understand"") and expressing their personal belief/opinion about how gaming mentality has changed over time. They're not seeking information (though they are confused), but rather stating their perspective on the situation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **CLAIM**: This fits well because the speaker is making subjective assertions about their understanding (or lack thereof) and expressing beliefs about gaming culture that are unverifiable opinions
   - **INQUIRE**: Less likely, as they're not directly asking a question, though they are expressing confusion
   - **INFORM**: Less likely, as they're not providing factual information but rather personal opinions and subjective states

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance doesn't contain clear politeness or impoliteness markers. It's a neutral expression of the speaker's perspective without attacking or particularly honoring anyone's face.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This appears to be bona fide communication - the speaker is genuinely expressing their confusion and opinion. There's no sarcasm, irony, or reported speech present.

The primary function is expressing the speaker's subjective mental state (""I do not understand"") and their personal beliefs about gaming culture, which aligns with CLAIM as it involves subjective assertions that are unverifiable in principle.

6,1,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,Did you ask your friends? ,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Inquire,,,"Let me analyze the target utterance ""Did you ask your friends?"" step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The utterance is a direct question from AurelianoTampa to CallSign_Fjor. CallSign_Fjor has been explaining a recurring pattern where friends lose interest in games when he progresses further, and he's expressing confusion about why this happens. He's provided multiple examples and is seeking understanding about this mentality.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa is asking whether CallSign_Fjor has directly communicated with his friends to understand their perspective. This appears to be a genuine information-seeking question that suggests a practical solution to the problem - direct communication rather than speculation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INQUIRE**: This is a direct question seeking factual information about whether a specific action (asking friends) has been taken
   - **DIRECT**: Could be interpreted as an indirect suggestion/advice that he should ask his friends
   - **INVITE**: Could be seen as inviting consideration of this approach

The primary function is clearly seeking information about whether this communication has occurred. While there's an implicit suggestion that this might be a good approach, the surface form and primary intent is to gather information.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The question is neutral and straightforward. It's not particularly polite or impolite - it's a direct, practical question without hedging or face-threatening elements.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is a straightforward, sincere question with no indication of sarcasm, irony, or reported speech. It appears to be bona fide communication.

The utterance is primarily functioning as an information-seeking question about whether direct communication has occurred, making INQUIRE the most appropriate classification.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

Let me analyze the target utterance ""Did you ask your friends?"" step by step:

1. **Reading the target utterance in context**: The utterance is a direct question from AurelianoTampa to CallSign_Fjor. CallSign_Fjor has been explaining a recurring pattern where friends lose interest in games when he progresses further, and he's expressing confusion about why this happens. He's provided multiple examples and is seeking understanding about this mentality.

2. **Identifying the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa is asking whether CallSign_Fjor has directly communicated with his friends to understand their perspective. This appears to be a genuine information-seeking question that suggests a practical solution to the problem - direct communication rather than speculation.

3. **Considering 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **INQUIRE**: This is a direct question seeking factual information about whether a specific action (asking friends) has been taken
   - **DIRECT**: Could be interpreted as an indirect suggestion/advice that he should ask his friends
   - **INVITE**: Could be seen as inviting consideration of this approach

The primary function is clearly seeking information about whether this communication has occurred. While there's an implicit suggestion that this might be a good approach, the surface form and primary intent is to gather information.

4. **Evaluating politeness/impoliteness**: The question is neutral and straightforward. It's not particularly polite or impolite - it's a direct, practical question without hedging or face-threatening elements.

5. **Checking for meta-acts**: This is a straightforward, sincere question with no indication of sarcasm, irony, or reported speech. It appears to be bona fide communication.

The utterance is primarily functioning as an information-seeking question about whether direct communication has occurred, making INQUIRE the most appropriate classification.
