1.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,Claim,,non-bona fide,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"" This is the opening line of a Reddit post where the user expresses confusion about why friends lose interest in a game if someone else progresses faster.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The user is trying to understand a particular behavior in multiplayer gaming contexts. The phrasing ""What's up with"" suggests a rhetorical question or an expression of confusion rather than a direct inquiry seeking factual information.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The surface form of the utterance is a question, suggesting an inquiry. However, it's framed more as a rhetorical question expressing confusion rather than a genuine request for information.
   - **Claim**: The rhetorical nature of the question implies a claim about the speaker's confusion or disbelief regarding the behavior of others.
   - **React**: The utterance could be interpreted as a reaction to the situation, expressing the speaker's surprise or frustration.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no explicit expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. The speaker is expressing confusion, which is a neutral stance.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The rhetorical nature of the question suggests it is non-bona fide communication, as the speaker is not genuinely seeking an answer but rather expressing a viewpoint or emotion.

The most fitting act is **Claim** due to the rhetorical nature of the question, which expresses the speaker's confusion or disbelief about the situation. The meta-act is **non-bona fide** because it is a rhetorical question.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance describes CallSign_Fjor's actions of playing Terraria with friends, starting a single-player game, and providing extra summons to friends. It provides a sequence of events and actions related to the gaming situation.  
2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent here is to describe the sequence of events and provide factual information about what happened during the gaming sessions.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the speaker's actions and what happened during the game.  
   - **Elaborate**: The utterance could be seen as expanding on the speaker's previous thoughts about why their friends lost interest in playing.  
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be expressing a subjective viewpoint on the situation.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. The speaker is neutrally providing information.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The speaker is straightforwardly providing factual details.  

Based on the content and context, the most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is **Inform** because the speaker is providing factual information about their actions and the situation with their friends during the game.

2.0,2.0,,,CallSign_Fjor,,"When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. ",,,Inform,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is, ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" This is part of a longer explanation by CallSign_Fjor about their friends losing interest in a game due to their solo progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is recounting an event where they informed their friends about their solo progression in the game, and the subsequent reaction of the friends losing interest. The primary intent seems to be to explain a situation and its outcome.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about what happened when they told their friends about their solo progression. This is verifiable in principle (i.e., the friends' reaction is an observable event).
   - **Claim**: The speaker is expressing their perspective on the situation, which includes subjective elements, such as the interpretation of the friends' lack of interest.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker could be elaborating on their previous statement about playing with friends and the dynamics that followed.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is a neutral recounting of events.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance contains an element of reported speech (""When I told them""), but the main communicative act is about the reaction of the friends, which makes ""Inform"" more relevant. The reported speech is not the focus but provides context for the information being shared.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" as it aligns with the speaker's intent to provide factual information about the situation and the friends' reaction.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is, ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" This is part of a longer explanation by CallSign_Fjor about their friends losing interest in a game due to their solo progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is recounting an event where they informed their friends about their solo progression in the game, and the subsequent reaction of the friends losing interest. The primary intent seems to be to explain a situation and its outcome.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about what happened when they told their friends about their solo progression. This is verifiable in principle (i.e., the friends' reaction is an observable event).
   - **Claim**: The speaker is expressing their perspective on the situation, which includes subjective elements, such as the interpretation of the friends' lack of interest.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker could be elaborating on their previous statement about playing with friends and the dynamics that followed.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is a neutral recounting of events.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance contains an element of reported speech (""When I told them""), but the main communicative act is about the reaction of the friends, which makes ""Inform"" more relevant. The reported speech is not the focus but provides context for the information being shared.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" as it aligns with the speaker's intent to provide factual information about the situation and the friends' reaction.

2.0,3.0,,,CallSign_Fjor,,It's been a week ,,,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""It's been a week"" appears in a context where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining that after they told their friends they had finished the game in single-player mode, their friends lost interest in continuing to play together. The friends have not rejoined in a week, and their excuse is that CallSign_Fjor has already explored everything.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's intent seems to be to provide information about the timeframe since the friends last participated in the game. This is part of an explanation of the situation to give context about the friends' lack of interest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the time that has elapsed since the friends last joined.
   - **Elaborate**: It could be seen as an elaboration on the previous statement about the friends' excuse for not playing.
   - **React**: It might express some form of reaction to the situation, although this is less direct.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement of fact.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the primary act is to **Inform** about the timeframe, providing factual information.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""It's been a week"" appears in a context where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining that after they told their friends they had finished the game in single-player mode, their friends lost interest in continuing to play together. The friends have not rejoined in a week, and their excuse is that CallSign_Fjor has already explored everything.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker's intent seems to be to provide information about the timeframe since the friends last participated in the game. This is part of an explanation of the situation to give context about the friends' lack of interest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the time that has elapsed since the friends last joined.
   - **Elaborate**: It could be seen as an elaboration on the previous statement about the friends' excuse for not playing.
   - **React**: It might express some form of reaction to the situation, although this is less direct.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement of fact.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony.

Given the context and the content of the utterance, the primary act is to **Inform** about the timeframe, providing factual information.

2.0,4.0,,,CallSign_Fjor,,and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.,,,Inform,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" is part of a message where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them. The speaker is recounting the friends' reason for not returning to the game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent here is to report the reason given by the friends for not playing. The speaker is not making a claim of their own or expressing a belief; rather, they are stating what the friends have said as their excuse.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about the friends' stated reason for not playing.  
   - **Claim**: Could be considered if the speaker were expressing a personal belief about the situation, but the speaker is instead recounting what others have said.  
   - **Report [reported]**: The speaker is relaying what the friends have said as their excuse, which aligns with reported speech.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting the friends' excuse.  

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The phrase ""their excuse is that"" indicates that the speaker is reporting what the friends have said. This fits the definition of reported speech, as the speaker is conveying the friends' statement rather than making their own independent assertion.  

The most fitting label for this utterance is INFORM with the meta-act of reported speech.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" is part of a message where the speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is explaining why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them. The speaker is recounting the friends' reason for not returning to the game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The primary intent here is to report the reason given by the friends for not playing. The speaker is not making a claim of their own or expressing a belief; rather, they are stating what the friends have said as their excuse.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about the friends' stated reason for not playing.  
   - **Claim**: Could be considered if the speaker were expressing a personal belief about the situation, but the speaker is instead recounting what others have said.  
   - **Report [reported]**: The speaker is relaying what the friends have said as their excuse, which aligns with reported speech.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting the friends' excuse.  

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The phrase ""their excuse is that"" indicates that the speaker is reporting what the friends have said. This fits the definition of reported speech, as the speaker is conveying the friends' statement rather than making their own independent assertion.  

The most fitting label for this utterance is INFORM with the meta-act of reported speech.
