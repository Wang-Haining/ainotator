1,1,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,Inquire,,,,"1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance is ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"" This is the opening line of CallSign_Fjor's post, where they express confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing games with them due to their faster progression.

2. **Speaker's intent**: The intent behind the utterance seems to be to express confusion and seek an explanation for a phenomenon they do not understand. The speaker is questioning why others react negatively to their progression in the game.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is asking a question about others' behavior and seeking information or clarification.
   - **Claim**: It could be seen as a rhetorical question that implies a claim about people's behavior.
   - **React**: It could be expressing a reaction of frustration or confusion.

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function here is to **Inquire**. The speaker is genuinely seeking an explanation for why people behave in this way, as indicated by the question format and the context of the post.

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is a neutral inquiry.

6. **Check for meta-acts**: The question could be rhetorical if the speaker already knows the answer, but given the context where they express genuine confusion, it is not non-bona fide. There is no reported speech involved.

In summary, the utterance is an inquiry into the reasons behind others' behavior, with no clear politeness or meta-act involved.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

In these cases, if the reported act is the most important information in the utterance, code it the same as a direct quotation.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “I heard teenagers group up on the new guys and beat them.” → code INFORM \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “(I used to make jokes or references to very popular memes or videos from youtube, etc) and OP would never understand what I was talking about.” → code CLAIM \\[reported\\]\n\nIf the reported act is NOT the most important information in the utterance, assign the act code to the main proposition of the utterance, e.g., “She said …” and “I heard …” in the examples above, both of which would be coded INFORM. In that case, do not assign the reported act meta-act.\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **\\+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **\\-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc. | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **\\-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room) | \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it \\[kill him\\]? If so why?\""; \""So how's school, love, family life?\"" |\n\n### II. Culpeper (2011a) Impoliteness Formulae\n\n*(subtypes of \\-P; specify in brackets)*\n\nExamples include:\n\n- **\\-P \\[Insult\\]**: \""You fucking moron\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Condescension\\]**: \""That's being babyish\""; \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Dismissal\\]**: \""Fuck off\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Silencer\\]**: \""Shut the fuck up\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Threat\\]**: \""I'm going to bust your head\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Negative association\\]**: \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\""\n\n<!-- ## Annotation -->\n<!-- ### Procedure\n\n1. **Read the target utterance carefully** in relation to the supplied context, including background story, preceding and following messages  \n2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context, not only the surface form of the message** \\- what is the primary communicative goal?  \n3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options** and then select the primary communicative function, politeness (if strong enough), and meta-act (and subtype) when appropriate  \n4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness** only if clearly expressed (not neutral interactions)  \n5. **Check for meta-acts** \\- is this reported perspective, or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm, irony, or a rhetorical question?  \n6. **When reasoning is requested**, think aloud step-by-step inside \\[REASON\\]…\\[/REASON\\] following steps 1-5 -->\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Multi-functional utterances**: Choose the primary/dominant function when an utterance is unclear or serves multiple communicative goals  \n- Choose the **less frequent** act **only if multiple acts are equally plausible**, as it is typically more informative.  \n  - **Most common**: claim, inform, inquire, react, elaborate  \n  - **Next most common**: direct, desire, accept, reject, congratulate, request, invite  \n  - **Least common**: manage, behave, thank, apologize, greet, repair  \n- **Reported perspective**: If the reported content contains the most important or relevant communicative act in context, annotate that rather than the reporting frame  \n- **ALL CAPS**:  capitalization indicates emphasis; a word or phrase in ALL CAPS sometimes is perceived as shouting. As such, words or utterances written in ALL CAPS may emphasize impoliteness if the utterance or context contains other cues to impoliteness. Otherwise, they are just emphatic, and not impolite.   \n-   \n  - Example: “I was gonna ask how they met and what HER reaction was” (ALL CAPS just indicates contrastive stress; it’s not impolite.)  \n  - Example: “It's a circular argument. YOU don't get paid enough to do something you like to do and you struggle, so your solution is for students to go into what they love even if they don't paid enough for it because that somehow changes the system?” (ALL CAPS emphasizes the commenter’s criticism; it’s a violation of positive politeness)\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""\\<ACT\\>\"",\""politeness\"":\""\\<POL\\>\"",\""meta\"":\""\\<META\\>\"",\""non-bona fide\"": \""\\<True\\>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)  \n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, \\+N, \\-P, \\-N) with subtype like \""-P \\[Insult\\]\"" (optional)  \n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With reported perspective: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""\"", \""non-bona fide\"":\""Ture\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function  \n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features  \n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically  \n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context  \n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent**: The primary intent of this utterance is to provide factual information about the user's actions and decisions while playing the game. The user is explaining the sequence of events and their behavior during the gameplay.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about their actions and decisions while playing the game. This aligns with the definition of the ""Inform"" act, as it involves stating and reporting actions.

1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance describes the user's actions while playing Terraria with friends. It details how the user started a single-player world and finished it, then rejoined their friends without using new gear and shared extra summons.  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent**: The primary intent of this utterance is to provide factual information about the user's actions and decisions while playing the game. The user is explaining the sequence of events and their behavior during the gameplay.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about their actions and decisions while playing the game. This aligns with the definition of the ""Inform"" act, as it involves stating and reporting actions.  
   - **Claim**: While the user is expressing their perspective, the utterance is more about reporting actions rather than subjective opinions or unverifiable assertions.  
   - **Elaborate**: The user is providing details, but it's not a paraphrase or comment on a previous statement.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral report of actions.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is straightforward and factual.  

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" as the utterance provides factual information about the user's actions in the game. There is no clear politeness or meta-act involved.

",,,Inform,,reported,,"1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" is part of CallSign_Fjor's explanation of why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them.  
2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: CallSign_Fjor is recounting an event where they informed their friends about their solo progression in the game. The primary goal seems to be providing an account of what happened, which led to their friends' disinterest.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about what CallSign_Fjor told their friends and the subsequent reaction of the friends.  
   - **Claim**: The utterance also reflects CallSign_Fjor’s perspective on the situation and how they interpret their friends’ reactions. However, the focus is more on recounting events.  
   - **Elaborate**: If considering the broader message, CallSign_Fjor might be elaborating on their previous points about the friends’ disinterest, but the utterance in isolation is more about providing specific information.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It is a neutral recount of events.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**:  
   - **Reported perspective**: The utterance contains a reported act (""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player""), but the main focus is on the resulting reaction of the friends, which is new information provided by CallSign_Fjor.  
   - **Non-bona fide**: There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or other non-bona fide communication in the utterance.  
6. **Select the primary act**: Based on the analysis, the primary act is **Inform**, as the utterance provides factual information about CallSign_Fjor's communication with their friends and their reaction.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday\\!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report, paraphrase (what someone else said; excluding one's own speech) | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that. First, ... Second, ...\""; \""That's my final word on the matter.\"" |\n| **React** | Show simple listenership, engagement (positive, negative, or neutral); you cannot react to your own speech or behavior | \""That's great/terrible\\!\""; \""hahaha\""; \""lmao\""; \""wow\""; \""hmm\""; \""ugh\""; \""yeah\"" |\n| **Reject** | Disagree, dispute, challenge; insult | \""No way is that accurate.\""; \""Gayyyy\"" |\n| **Repair** | Clarify or seek clarification; correct misunderstanding | \""Did you mean 'school holiday'?\""; \""Just kidding.\"" |\n| **Request** | Seek action politely, make direct or indirect request | \""Can you plz send pics?\""; \""Would you mind sharing the link?\"" |\n| **Thank** | Appreciate, express gratitude | \""Thanks so much.\""; \""It's very nice of you to offer.\"" |\n\n## Meta-Acts\n\n| Tag | Description | Examples |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\[reported\\]** | In the case of reported perspective, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most important in the utterance. In that case, the act code is assigned to the reported act, rather than to the main (embedding) clause, and the reported meta-act is also assigned to the utterance. | \""She said “I want to go”.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\] |\n| **\\[non-bona fide\\]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith. In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM \\[non-bona fide\\]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE \\[non-bona fide\\] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations enclosed in quotation marks, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, if the reported act is the most important information in the utterance, code it the same as a direct quotation.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “I heard teenagers group up on the new guys and beat them.” → code INFORM \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “(I used to make jokes or references to very popular memes or videos from youtube, etc) and OP would never understand what I was talking about.” → code CLAIM \\[reported\\]\n\nIf the reported act is NOT the most important information in the utterance, assign the act code to the main proposition of the utterance, e.g., “She said …” and “I heard …” in the examples above, both of which would be coded INFORM. In that case, do not assign the reported act meta-act.\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance ""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on."" is part of CallSign_Fjor's explanation of why their friends lost interest in playing Terraria with them.  
2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: CallSign_Fjor is recounting an event where they informed their friends about their solo progression in the game. The primary goal seems to be providing an account of what happened, which led to their friends' disinterest.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about what CallSign_Fjor told their friends and the subsequent reaction of the friends.  
   - **Claim**: The utterance also reflects CallSign_Fjor’s perspective on the situation and how they interpret their friends’ reactions. However, the focus is more on recounting events.  
   - **Elaborate**: If considering the broader message, CallSign_Fjor might be elaborating on their previous points about the friends’ disinterest, but the utterance in isolation is more about providing specific information.  
4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It is a neutral recount of events.  
5. **Check for meta-acts**:  
   - **Reported perspective**: The utterance contains a reported act (""When I told them I went and beat the game in single player""), but the main focus is on the resulting reaction of the friends, which is new information provided by CallSign_Fjor.  
   - **Non-bona fide**: There is no indication of sarcasm, irony, or other non-bona fide communication in the utterance.  
6. **Select the primary act**: Based on the analysis, the primary act is **Inform**, as the utterance provides factual information about CallSign_Fjor's communication with their friends and their reaction.

The utterance is situated in a narrative detailing how CallSign_Fjor's friends lost interest after learning that CallSign_Fjor had progressed further in the game.  
2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: The primary intent of the utterance ""It's been a week"" is to provide a factual piece of information about the duration since the friends have stopped playing. It serves as a temporal marker to emphasize how long it's been since the friends last joined the game, supporting the explanation of the situation.  
3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides a factual piece of information regarding the timeline.  
   - **Claim**: While it could be considered a claim if the focus was on the speaker's perception of time, in this context, the statement is more about providing a verifiable piece of information.  
   - The most fitting act is **Inform** because the utterance provides a specific, verifiable piece of information about the timeline.

Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday\\!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report, paraphrase (what someone else said; excluding one's own speech) | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that. First, ... Second, ...\""; \""That's my final word on the matter.\"" |\n| **React** | Show simple listenership, engagement (positive, negative, or neutral); you cannot react to your own speech or behavior | \""That's great/terrible\\!\""; \""hahaha\""; \""lmao\""; \""wow\""; \""hmm\""; \""ugh\""; \""yeah\"" |\n| **Reject** | Disagree, dispute, challenge; insult | \""No way is that accurate.\""; \""Gayyyy\"" |\n| **Repair** | Clarify or seek clarification; correct misunderstanding | \""Did you mean 'school holiday'?\""; \""Just kidding.\"" |\n| **Request** | Seek action politely, make direct or indirect request | \""Can you plz send pics?\""; \""Would you mind sharing the link?\"" |\n| **Thank** | Appreciate, express gratitude | \""Thanks so much.\""; \""It's very nice of you to offer.\"" |\n\n## Meta-Acts\n\n| Tag | Description | Examples |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\[reported\\]** | In the case of reported perspective, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most important in the utterance. In that case, the act code is assigned to the reported act, rather than to the main (embedding) clause, and the reported meta-act is also assigned to the utterance. | \""She said “I want to go”.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\] |\n| **\\[non-bona fide\\]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith. In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM \\[non-bona fide\\]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE \\[non-bona fide\\] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations enclosed in quotation marks, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, if the reported act is the most important information in the utterance, code it the same as a direct quotation.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “I heard teenagers group up on the new guys and beat them.” → code INFORM \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “(I used to make jokes or references to very popular memes or videos from youtube, etc) and OP would never understand what I was talking about.” → code CLAIM \\[reported\\]\n\nIf the reported act is NOT the most important information in the utterance, assign the act code to the main proposition of the utterance, e.g., “She said …” and “I heard …” in the examples above, both of which would be coded INFORM. In that case, do not assign the reported act meta-act.\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **\\+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **\\-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc. | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **\\-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room) | \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it \\[kill him\\]? If so why?\""; \""So how's school, love, family life?\"" |\n\n### II. Culpeper (2011a) Impoliteness Formulae\n\n*(subtypes of \\-P; specify in brackets)*\n\nExamples include:\n\n- **\\-P \\[Insult\\]**: \""You fucking moron\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Condescension\\]**: \""That's being babyish\""; \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Dismissal\\]**: \""Fuck off\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Silencer\\]**: \""Shut the fuck up\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Threat\\]**: \""I'm going to bust your head\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Negative association\\]**: \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\""\n\n<!-- ## Annotation -->\n<!-- ### Procedure\n\n1. **Read the target utterance carefully** in relation to the supplied context, including background story, preceding and following messages  \n2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context, not only the surface form of the message** \\- what is the primary communicative goal?  \n3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options** and then select the primary communicative function, politeness (if strong enough), and meta-act (and subtype) when appropriate  \n4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness** only if clearly expressed (not neutral interactions)  \n5. **Check for meta-acts** \\- is this reported perspective, or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm, irony, or a rhetorical question?  \n6. **When reasoning is requested**, think aloud step-by-step inside \\[REASON\\]…\\[/REASON\\] following steps 1-5 -->\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Multi-functional utterances**: Choose the primary/dominant function when an utterance is unclear or serves multiple communicative goals  \n- Choose the **less frequent** act **only if multiple acts are equally plausible**, as it is typically more informative.  \n  - **Most common**: claim, inform, inquire, react, elaborate  \n  - **Next most common**: direct, desire, accept, reject, congratulate, request, invite  \n  - **Least common**: manage, behave, thank, apologize, greet, repair  \n- **Reported perspective**: If the reported content contains the most important or relevant communicative act in context, annotate that rather than the reporting frame  \n- **ALL CAPS**:  capitalization indicates emphasis; a word or phrase in ALL CAPS sometimes is perceived as shouting. As such, words or utterances written in ALL CAPS may emphasize impoliteness if the utterance or context contains other cues to impoliteness. Otherwise, they are just emphatic, and not impolite.   \n-   \n  - Example: “I was gonna ask how they met and what HER reaction was” (ALL CAPS just indicates contrastive stress; it’s not impolite.)  \n  - Example: “It's a circular argument. YOU don't get paid enough to do something you like to do and you struggle, so your solution is for students to go into what they love even if they don't paid enough for it because that somehow changes the system?” (ALL CAPS emphasizes the commenter’s criticism; it’s a violation of positive politeness)\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""\\<ACT\\>\"",\""politeness\"":\""\\<POL\\>\"",\""meta\"":\""\\<META\\>\"",\""non-bona fide\"": \""\\<True\\>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)  \n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, \\+N, \\-P, \\-N) with subtype like \""-P \\[Insult\\]\"" (optional)  \n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With reported perspective: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""\"", \""non-bona fide\"":\""Ture\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function  \n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features  \n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically  \n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context  \n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday\\!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report, paraphrase (what someone else said; excluding one's own speech) | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that.

In that case, the act code is assigned to the reported act, rather than to the main (embedding) clause, and the reported meta-act is also assigned to the utterance. | \""She said “I want to go”.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\] |\n| **\\[non-bona fide\\]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith. In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM \\[non-bona fide\\]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE \\[non-bona fide\\] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations enclosed in quotation marks, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, if the reported act is the most important information in the utterance, code it the same as a direct quotation.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “I heard teenagers group up on the new guys and beat them.” → code INFORM \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “(I used to make jokes or references to very popular memes or videos from youtube, etc) and OP would never understand what I was talking about.” → code CLAIM \\[reported\\]\n\nIf the reported act is NOT the most important information in the utterance, assign the act code to the main proposition of the utterance, e.g., “She said …” and “I heard …” in the examples above, both of which would be coded INFORM. In that case, do not assign the reported act meta-act.\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **\\+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **\\-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc. | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **\\-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room) | \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it \\[kill him\\]?

As such, words or utterances written in ALL CAPS may emphasize impoliteness if the utterance or context contains other cues to impoliteness. Otherwise, they are just emphatic, and not impolite.   \n-   \n  - Example: “I was gonna ask how they met and what HER reaction was” (ALL CAPS just indicates contrastive stress; it’s not impolite.)  \n  - Example: “It's a circular argument. YOU don't get paid enough to do something you like to do and you struggle, so your solution is for students to go into what they love even if they don't paid enough for it because that somehow changes the system?” (ALL CAPS emphasizes the commenter’s criticism; it’s a violation of positive politeness)\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""\\<ACT\\>\"",\""politeness\"":\""\\<POL\\>\"",\""meta\"":\""\\<META\\>\"",\""non-bona fide\"": \""\\<True\\>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)  \n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, \\+N, \\-P, \\-N) with subtype like \""-P \\[Insult\\]\"" (optional)  \n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With reported perspective: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""\"", \""non-bona fide\"":\""Ture\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function  \n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features  \n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically  \n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context  \n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The target utterance is ""and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game."" It is part of a narrative where the speaker explains why their friends lost interest in playing the game with them.  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: The speaker's intent seems to be to convey the reason given by their friends for losing interest in the game. This is part of a larger explanation of why the speaker thinks their friends are no longer interested in playing.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about what the friends said, which is verifiable in principle.  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is expressing their interpretation of the friends' behavior, which could be seen as subjective.  
   - **React**: The speaker could be expressing a reaction to their friends' excuse.  

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function is **Inform** because the speaker is reporting what the friends said as the reason for their disinterest. It is presented as a factual statement.  

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral statement.  

6. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance involves reported speech, as the speaker is conveying what the friends said. Therefore, the meta-act is **reported**.  

7. **Final decision**: The communicative act is **Inform** with a meta-act of **reported**.

At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.""  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is recounting a past experience where their actions in a game led to another player quitting. The speaker's intent is to illustrate a pattern of behavior where their progression or actions in games lead to others feeling invalidated or discouraged.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about a past event that is verifiable in principle. This is a factual recounting of what happened in the game Pax Dei.
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be seen as making a subjective assertion about their experience and feelings regarding the situation.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is expanding on their earlier point about player dynamics in games.

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function here is to **Inform**. The utterance provides factual information about a past incident in another game, Pax Dei, where the speaker's actions led to a similar outcome as the current situation in Terraria.

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral recounting of events.

6. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The speaker is sincerely recounting their experience.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate annotation for the utterance is ""Inform"" with no politeness or meta-act markers.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance is ""This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.""  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is recounting a past experience where their actions in a game led to another player quitting. The speaker's intent is to illustrate a pattern of behavior where their progression or actions in games lead to others feeling invalidated or discouraged.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing information about a past event that is verifiable in principle. This is a factual recounting of what happened in the game Pax Dei.
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be seen as making a subjective assertion about their experience and feelings regarding the situation.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is expanding on their earlier point about player dynamics in games.

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function here is to **Inform**. The utterance provides factual information about a past incident in another game, Pax Dei, where the speaker's actions led to a similar outcome as the current situation in Terraria.

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a neutral recounting of events.

6. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The speaker is sincerely recounting their experience.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate annotation for the utterance is ""Inform"" with no politeness or meta-act markers.

3,2,,,CallSign_Fjor,,Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,,Inform,,reported,,"1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" is part of a message where CallSign_Fjor is explaining why one of their friends stopped playing a game with them.  

2. **Contextual understanding**: The speaker is recounting a situation where their actions in a game led to a friend feeling invalidated. This is a follow-up to the user's description of their gaming experiences with friends, where progression differences caused issues.  

3. **Speaker's intent**: The primary communicative goal is to convey the friend's perspective on why they stopped playing. The user is explaining the friend's viewpoint, not necessarily agreeing with it.  

4. **Consider plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the friend's stance.  
   - **Claim**: Since the speaker is relaying someone else's opinion, there is a subjective element. However, the statement is presented as the friend's perspective, not the speaker's personal opinion.  
   - **Report**: The utterance is a clear example of reported speech, as it conveys what the friend believed.  

5. **Meta-acts**: The utterance involves reporting the perspective of the friend, thus qualifying for the \[reported\] meta-act.  

6. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is neutral and factual in tone.  

7. **Conclusion**: The primary act is to **Inform** about the friend's stance, with the \[reported\] meta-act indicating that this is a relaying of someone else's perspective.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.) It will never work.\""; \""(I did what you said.) I got a haircut.\"" |\n| **Greet** | Greeting and leave takings; Formulaic inquiries about and wishes for well-being; Formulaic responses to 1 and 2 | \""Hello\""; \""Bye\""; \""See you later\""; \""How are you?\""; \""I'm fine, thanks. And you?\""; \""Happy birthday\\!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report, paraphrase (what someone else said; excluding one's own speech) | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that. First, ... Second, ...\""; \""That's my final word on the matter.\"" |\n| **React** | Show simple listenership, engagement (positive, negative, or neutral); you cannot react to your own speech or behavior | \""That's great/terrible\\!\""; \""hahaha\""; \""lmao\""; \""wow\""; \""hmm\""; \""ugh\""; \""yeah\"" |\n| **Reject** | Disagree, dispute, challenge; insult | \""No way is that accurate.\""; \""Gayyyy\"" |\n| **Repair** | Clarify or seek clarification; correct misunderstanding | \""Did you mean 'school holiday'?\""; \""Just kidding.\"" |\n| **Request** | Seek action politely, make direct or indirect request | \""Can you plz send pics?\""; \""Would you mind sharing the link?\"" |\n| **Thank** | Appreciate, express gratitude | \""Thanks so much.\""; \""It's very nice of you to offer.\"" |\n\n## Meta-Acts\n\n| Tag | Description | Examples |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\[reported\\]** | In the case of reported perspective, the reported act (embedded utterance) itself will often be most important in the utterance. In that case, the act code is assigned to the reported act, rather than to the main (embedding) clause, and the reported meta-act is also assigned to the utterance. | \""She said “I want to go”.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\] |\n| **\\[non-bona fide\\]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith. In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM \\[non-bona fide\\]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE \\[non-bona fide\\] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations enclosed in quotation marks, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, if the reported act is the most important information in the utterance, code it the same as a direct quotation.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “I heard teenagers group up on the new guys and beat them.” → code INFORM \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “(I used to make jokes or references to very popular memes or videos from youtube, etc) and OP would never understand what I was talking about.” → code CLAIM \\[reported\\]\n\nIf the reported act is NOT the most important information in the utterance, assign the act code to the main proposition of the utterance, e.g., “She said …” and “I heard …” in the examples above, both of which would be coded INFORM. In that case, do not assign the reported act meta-act.\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance ""Their stance was that I invalidated them."" is part of a message where CallSign_Fjor is explaining why one of their friends stopped playing a game with them.  

2. **Contextual understanding**: The speaker is recounting a situation where their actions in a game led to a friend feeling invalidated. This is a follow-up to the user's description of their gaming experiences with friends, where progression differences caused issues.  

3. **Speaker's intent**: The primary communicative goal is to convey the friend's perspective on why they stopped playing. The user is explaining the friend's viewpoint, not necessarily agreeing with it.  

4. **Consider plausible options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the friend's stance.  
   - **Claim**: Since the speaker is relaying someone else's opinion, there is a subjective element. However, the statement is presented as the friend's perspective, not the speaker's personal opinion.  
   - **Report**: The utterance is a clear example of reported speech, as it conveys what the friend believed.  

5. **Meta-acts**: The utterance involves reporting the perspective of the friend, thus qualifying for the \[reported\] meta-act.  

6. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. It is neutral and factual in tone.  

7. **Conclusion**: The primary act is to **Inform** about the friend's stance, with the \[reported\] meta-act indicating that this is a relaying of someone else's perspective.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?""  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, seems to be expressing confusion and seeking an explanation for why their friends feel invalidated by their progress in the game. The speaker is questioning the logic behind their friends' reactions.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is asking questions, which suggests they are seeking information or an explanation about their friends' behavior.  
   - **Claim**: The speaker might be making a claim about not understanding the mentality of others. However, the presence of questions suggests a stronger intent to seek information.  
   - **React**: The statement could be seen as a reaction to their friends' behavior, but it is more focused on seeking answers.

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function of this utterance is to **Inquire**. The speaker asks two questions, indicating a desire to understand why their actions affect their friends' motivation in the game.

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. The questions are neutral and do not attack or compliment the addressees.

6. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is sincere and does not involve reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The questions are genuine.

7. **Conclusion**: The utterance is primarily an inquiry seeking understanding about the situation described in the context.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.)

And you?\""; \""Happy birthday\\!\"" |\n| **Inform** | Provide \""factual\"" information that is verifiable in principle, even if untrue; inform, state, report, paraphrase (what someone else said; excluding one's own speech) | \""Paris is the capital of France.\""; \""My uncle just bought a jet.\""; \""I've never been here before.\"" |\n| **Inquire** | Seek information, ask; make neutral or marked proposals | \""What are you guys eating?\""; \""There's still time, right?\"" |\n| **Invite** | Invite, seek participation; Suggest; solicit input; Offer | \""Please join us.\""; \""What if we did it this way?\""; \""Let me help you.\"" |\n| **Manage** | Manage the discourse, e.g., organize, prompt, focus, open or close discussions | \""I have two thoughts about that.

In that case, the act code is assigned to the reported act, rather than to the main (embedding) clause, and the reported meta-act is also assigned to the utterance. | \""She said “I want to go”.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\] |\n| **\\[non-bona fide\\]** | Bona fide communication is the default in speech act analysis; that is, the utterance producer is presumed to be producing acts sincerely and in good faith. In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM \\[non-bona fide\\]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE \\[non-bona fide\\] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations enclosed in quotation marks, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, if the reported act is the most important information in the utterance, code it the same as a direct quotation.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “I heard teenagers group up on the new guys and beat them.” → code INFORM \\[reported\\]  \n- Example: “(I used to make jokes or references to very popular memes or videos from youtube, etc) and OP would never understand what I was talking about.” → code CLAIM \\[reported\\]\n\nIf the reported act is NOT the most important information in the utterance, assign the act code to the main proposition of the utterance, e.g., “She said …” and “I heard …” in the examples above, both of which would be coded INFORM. In that case, do not assign the reported act meta-act.\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **\\+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **\\+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **\\-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc. | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **\\-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room) | \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it \\[kill him\\]? If so why?\""; \""So how's school, love, family life?\"" |\n\n### II. Culpeper (2011a) Impoliteness Formulae\n\n*(subtypes of \\-P; specify in brackets)*\n\nExamples include:\n\n- **\\-P \\[Insult\\]**: \""You fucking moron\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Condescension\\]**: \""That's being babyish\""; \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Dismissal\\]**: \""Fuck off\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Silencer\\]**: \""Shut the fuck up\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Threat\\]**: \""I'm going to bust your head\""  \n- **\\-P \\[Negative association\\]**: \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\""\n\n<!-- ## Annotation -->\n<!-- ### Procedure\n\n1. **Read the target utterance carefully** in relation to the supplied context, including background story, preceding and following messages  \n2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context, not only the surface form of the message** \\- what is the primary communicative goal?  \n3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options** and then select the primary communicative function, politeness (if strong enough), and meta-act (and subtype) when appropriate  \n4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness** only if clearly expressed (not neutral interactions)  \n5. **Check for meta-acts** \\- is this reported perspective, or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm, irony, or a rhetorical question?  \n6. **When reasoning is requested**, think aloud step-by-step inside \\[REASON\\]…\\[/REASON\\] following steps 1-5 -->\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Multi-functional utterances**: Choose the primary/dominant function when an utterance is unclear or serves multiple communicative goals  \n- Choose the **less frequent** act **only if multiple acts are equally plausible**, as it is typically more informative.  \n  - **Most common**: claim, inform, inquire, react, elaborate  \n  - **Next most common**: direct, desire, accept, reject, congratulate, request, invite  \n  - **Least common**: manage, behave, thank, apologize, greet, repair  \n- **Reported perspective**: If the reported content contains the most important or relevant communicative act in context, annotate that rather than the reporting frame  \n- **ALL CAPS**:  capitalization indicates emphasis; a word or phrase in ALL CAPS sometimes is perceived as shouting. As such, words or utterances written in ALL CAPS may emphasize impoliteness if the utterance or context contains other cues to impoliteness. Otherwise, they are just emphatic, and not impolite.   \n-   \n  - Example: “I was gonna ask how they met and what HER reaction was” (ALL CAPS just indicates contrastive stress; it’s not impolite.)  \n  - Example: “It's a circular argument. YOU don't get paid enough to do something you like to do and you struggle, so your solution is for students to go into what they love even if they don't paid enough for it because that somehow changes the system?” (ALL CAPS emphasizes the commenter’s criticism; it’s a violation of positive politeness)\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""\\<ACT\\>\"",\""politeness\"":\""\\<POL\\>\"",\""meta\"":\""\\<META\\>\"",\""non-bona fide\"": \""\\<True\\>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)  \n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, \\+N, \\-P, \\-N) with subtype like \""-P \\[Insult\\]\"" (optional)  \n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- With reported perspective: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`  \n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""\"", \""non-bona fide\"":\""Ture\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function  \n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features  \n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically  \n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context  \n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The utterance ""I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player 'had the thing' it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you."" is a reflective statement by CallSign_Fjor about their confusion regarding why others are discouraged by their progression in a game.  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: The speaker is expressing a personal opinion or belief about the mentality of other players. The primary communicative goal is to express a subjective viewpoint about the situation, rather than to seek information or provide factual data.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle. The speaker is expressing their personal thoughts and feelings about the mentality of other players.  
   - **Inquire**: If interpreted as a rhetorical question or seeking understanding, it could be seen as an inquiry, but the overall tone is more about expressing confusion than actively seeking answers.  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is not providing factual information, so this is less plausible.  

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There are no clear politeness or impoliteness markers in this utterance. The speaker is neither enhancing nor attacking anyone's face needs.  

5. **Check for meta-acts**: The utterance is not reported speech, nor is it non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony. It seems to be a genuine expression of confusion and opinion.  

Given the context and the nature of the utterance, the most appropriate act is **Claim** because the speaker is expressing a subjective belief about the situation. There are no politeness or meta-act markers present in the utterance.

6,1,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,Did you ask your friends? ,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,Inquire,,,,"1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The target utterance is ""Did you ask your friends?"" This is a question directed at the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, regarding whether they have directly communicated with their friends about the issue they are experiencing.  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: AurelianoTampa seems to be probing the original poster to consider whether they have directly sought their friends' perspectives on the matter. The intent is likely to encourage the original poster to gain firsthand insights from the friends involved, which could help clarify the situation or resolve misunderstandings.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inquire**: This is a direct question asking for information about whether CallSign_Fjor has communicated with their friends.  
   - **Invite**: It could be seen as an indirect suggestion to talk to the friends to understand their perspective better.  
   - **Manage**: It could also be seen as an attempt to guide the conversation towards a productive resolution by prompting action.  

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function here is to seek information, as AurelianoTampa is asking a direct question. Therefore, the most appropriate label is **Inquire**.  

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a straightforward question without any additional markers of politeness or impoliteness.  

6. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication that this is a reported perspective or non-bona fide speech. The question seems sincere and direct.  

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate act is **Inquire**, with no additional politeness or meta-act annotations.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Your task is to read **a single utterance in context** and assign the correct **communicative-act label** from the taxonomy developed by **Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005)**, revised in **2024** by **Herring and Ge-Stadnyk**.\n\nThe CMC Act Taxonomy is a classification scheme developed in 2005 by Susan C. Herring, Anupam Das, and Shashikant Penumarthy for coding \""speech\"" acts in computer-mediated discourse. It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation | Example(s) |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act) | \""dances with joy\""; \""\\*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support | \""Well done\\!\""; \""Congratulations\\!\""; \""You've got this\\!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance | \""(His position is untenable.)

Please read the background and surrounding context carefully, then decide on the communicative act of the target utterance, its politeness value (if clearly expressed), and any applicable meta-acts. Use the CMC Communicative Act Taxonomy developed by Herring, Das, and Penumarthy (2005), revised in 2024 by Herring and Ge-Stadnyk, to guide your annotation. For politeness and impoliteness, refer to Herring (1994) and Culpeper's (2011a) frameworks. For meta-acts such as reported and non-bona fide speech, follow the definitions included in the taxonomy.\n\n**Background Context**: A Reddit user (CallSign_Fjor) posts in r/gaming that their friends lost interest in finishing Terraria and other games with them because the user had progressed farther, even though the user avoided using end-game gear and shared resources. The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). \n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #9 from AurelianoTampa:\n\""Did you ask your friends?\""\n\nUtterance #9 is a reply to user \""CallSign_Fjor\"". The following earlier messages by CallSign_Fjor may help contextualize the reply:\n- Utterance #1: \""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\""\n- Utterance #2: \""Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available.

Follow the annotation procedure: 1. **Read the target utterance carefully** in relation to the supplied context, including background story, preceding and following messages 2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context, not only the surface form of the message** - what is the primary communicative goal? 3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options** and then select the primary communicative function, politeness (if strong enough), and meta-act (and subtype) when appropriate 4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness** only if clearly expressed (not neutral interactions) 5. **Check for meta-acts** - is this reported perspective, or non-bona fide speech such as sarcasm, irony, or a rhetorical question? 6. **When reasoning is requested**, think aloud step-by-step inside [REASON]…[/REASON] following steps 1-5\n\n**Output Format**: First provide your step-by-step reasoning inside [REASON]…[/REASON], then return the annotation as one JSON object wrapped EXACTLY like:\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""< META >\"",\""non-bona fide\"":\""<NON_BONA_FIDE>\""}[/ANNOT]""}]","[REASON]  
1. **Read the target utterance carefully**: The target utterance is ""Did you ask your friends?"" This is a question directed at the original poster, CallSign_Fjor, regarding whether they have directly communicated with their friends about the issue they are experiencing.  

2. **Pay close attention to the speaker's intent in context**: AurelianoTampa seems to be probing the original poster to consider whether they have directly sought their friends' perspectives on the matter. The intent is likely to encourage the original poster to gain firsthand insights from the friends involved, which could help clarify the situation or resolve misunderstandings.  

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible options**:  
   - **Inquire**: This is a direct question asking for information about whether CallSign_Fjor has communicated with their friends.  
   - **Invite**: It could be seen as an indirect suggestion to talk to the friends to understand their perspective better.  
   - **Manage**: It could also be seen as an attempt to guide the conversation towards a productive resolution by prompting action.  

4. **Select the primary communicative function**: The primary function here is to seek information, as AurelianoTampa is asking a direct question. Therefore, the most appropriate label is **Inquire**.  

5. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a straightforward question without any additional markers of politeness or impoliteness.  

6. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication that this is a reported perspective or non-bona fide speech. The question seems sincere and direct.  

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate act is **Inquire**, with no additional politeness or meta-act annotations.
