2,1,250127,,CallSign_Fjor,,"Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.",,Original post,,0.0,Inform,,
