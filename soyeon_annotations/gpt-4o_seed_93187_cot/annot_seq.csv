2.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,"Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.",,Original post,,0.0,Inform,,,,,Claim,,
3.0,1.0,250127.0,,CallSign_Fjor,,This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,Original post,,0.0,Elaborate,,,,,Inform,,

There was a time when a player ""had the thing"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.",,Original post,,0.0,Claim,,,,,Claim,,

8.0,1.0,250127.0,,AurelianoTampa,,"As someone not involved, it sounds like they wanted to play and discover the game together. Knowing you had already gone through everything and now were just kinda babysitting them probably took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable. They wanted a new experience as a group, and you went and had the experience on your own. Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going ""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!"" It ruins the surprise.",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,D2,55.0,Desire (speculation),,,,,Claim,,
