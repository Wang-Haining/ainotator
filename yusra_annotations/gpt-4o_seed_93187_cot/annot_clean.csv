Inform,,,"The target utterance is the beginning of a narrative where the user, JuvieThrowaw, starts to recount past events involving his mother's abusive relationship. The phrase ""My mom was in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend when I was 12-14"" provides specific information about the past, which can be verified as factual based on the user's account. This fits the definition of the ""Inform"" communicative act, as it is delivering factual context necessary for the subsequent story. The utterance does not display any explicit politeness or impoliteness, nor does it contain any non-bona fide elements like sarcasm or humor.",0,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""He would beat her badly, leaving her with broken ribs, black eyes, etc."" provides factual information about the abuse the user's mother experienced. This statement is verifiable, as it describes specific physical injuries (broken ribs, black eyes) that result from the abuse. The context of the surrounding messages supports the interpretation that the user is recounting a factual narrative of past events. The previous message introduces the context of the abusive relationship, while the following message describes the mother's response to the abuse. The target utterance fits the ""Inform"" communicative act, as it conveys verifiable details about the abuse. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or irony in this statement. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform,"" with no politeness or meta-annotations.",1,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""My mom would always tell me and my sister to just ignore it."" describes a repeated action or behavior from the speaker's mother. The phrase ""would always tell"" indicates this is something she regularly did, suggesting a pattern or norm in their household. 

Potential labels for this could include:
1. **Inform**: This label would apply if the speaker is providing factual information about what the mother said, which is verifiable to the context of the speaker's life. 
2. **Claim**: This label might be considered if the speaker is making a subjective assertion that reflects a personal perspective rather than an objective fact.
3. **Elaborate**: This could be a possibility if the speaker is explaining a previously mentioned point about the mother's behavior, although there is no clear direct connection to elaboration in the previous utterance.

Given the context, the speaker is recounting a series of events and behaviors to paint a picture of the household environment. This suggests a factual recounting of what occurred, leaning towards an **Inform** act. The statement presents a factual recount of a pattern of behavior by the mother, rather than a subjective interpretation or further explanation of an earlier point. 

Therefore, the best label for this utterance is **Inform**, as it provides verifiable information about the actions of the mother in the context of the abusive situation. There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting in this utterance.",2,93187
Inform,,,"In this target utterance, ""One day, I came home from a friends house, and my little sister (10 at the time) was crying,"" the speaker provides a specific narrative detail. The focus is on describing an event that happened in the past. The utterance doesn't express any subjective feelings or unverifiable opinions, so it doesn't fit the ""Claim"" category. It also doesn't seek to explain or elaborate on something previously stated, which rules out ""Elaborate."" The utterance is providing factual information about a past event, making ""Inform"" the most fitting communicative act. There's no politeness or meta-act clearly expressed, so those fields will remain null.",3,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance is a narrative continuation of the previous message, where the user describes a specific incident that their sister experienced. The utterance provides factual details about what the sister said and showed to the user, namely that she was hit and thrown against the wall, resulting in bruises. 

To determine the communicative act, I consider:
1. **Inform**: The utterance provides specific, verifiable details about the sister's physical condition and the actions taken by the mother's boyfriend. It is meant to convey factual information to the audience about a past event.
2. **Claim**: Although the utterance contains an assertion, it is not primarily subjective or unverifiable in principle. It focuses on factual reporting rather than a personal opinion or belief.

Given the context, ""Inform"" is the most appropriate label because the user is sharing a concrete event and its consequences with the audience. The utterance does not contain any politeness or meta-acts, as it is straightforward factual reporting. Therefore, the annotation will focus solely on the communicative act.",4,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""In that moment, I went dark."" is a subjective expression of the speaker's emotional state or mental shift. The phrase ""went dark"" is often used metaphorically to describe someone experiencing a negative or intense emotional change, such as anger or despair. It is not providing factual information but rather describing the speaker's personal internal experience at that time. 

Considering the communicative acts, the most fitting label is ""Claim"" because the utterance makes a subjective assertion about the speaker's emotional state. It is unverifiable in principle because it's a personal feeling. Other possible acts like ""Inform"" or ""React"" do not fit as well because the utterance is not providing factual information or engaging directly with another user's comment. 

Therefore, ""Claim"" is the most appropriate label for this utterance. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting, so those tags are not applicable here.",5,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance provides factual information about the user's living environment and social connections. It states that they lived in a ""poor trailer trash town with high crime"" and had ""plenty of friends who had guns."" This statement offers context to the events being described but doesn't involve subjective opinion or unverifiable assertions. 

In considering the communicative-act labels, ""Inform"" is the most fitting because the user is providing factual context about their environment and social network, which is verifiable and objective. It doesn't express any desires, requests, or inquiries, nor does it engage in any form of direct communication such as directing or inviting. There are no markers of politeness or impoliteness in this statement, as it is presented in a neutral tone. Additionally, there are no meta-acts such as reported speech or non-bona fide language present.

Therefore, ""Inform"" is the appropriate label for this utterance, with no additional politeness or meta tags needed.",6,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance provides a sequential description of events, where the user narrates the actions taken after deciding to confront their mother's boyfriend. The user states that they went to a friend's house, explained the situation, and then together they drove to the boyfriend's house to wait for him. This is presented as a factual recounting of what happened, indicating that the communicative act is ""Inform.""

The prior message sets the context by explaining the environment and the access to guns, which leads into the decision-making and action described in the target utterance. The next message continues the narrative by detailing the subsequent action of the friend handing over the gun, reinforcing that the target utterance is a part of a factual sequence.

There are no elements of opinion, desire, or inquiry, nor is there a call to action or engagement with the audience in this utterance. It is a straightforward recount of events. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Inform."" There are no indicators of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any non-bona fide communication.",7,93187
Inform,,,"To determine the communicative act for the target utterance, let's first consider the context provided by the preceding and following utterances. The user is narrating a sequence of events leading up to and including the shooting of his mother's boyfriend. The target utterance describes a specific action: his friend handing him the gun.

1. **Potential Acts**:
   - **Inform**: The user is describing an action that happened, which is factual information within the narrative.
   - **Claim**: Since this is a personal narrative and unverifiable, one might consider it a subjective assertion.
   - **Elaborate**: It could be seen as providing more detail about the events leading up to the shooting.

2. **Analysis**:
   - **Inform** seems most appropriate as the user is providing a factual account within the story. The act of handing over the gun is a specific, verifiable event within the narrative.
   - **Claim** is less fitting because the user is not expressing a subjective opinion or belief but recounting a series of events.
   - **Elaborate** is possible but less direct, as the user is not necessarily expanding upon a prior statement but rather continuing the chronological narrative.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The primary function of the utterance is to inform the reader of the specific action that occurred in the sequence of events. Therefore, ""Inform"" is the most fitting label.

There are no clear markers of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance, and no meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting are present. Hence, we focus solely on the act of informing.",8,93189
Reject,-P,,"The target utterance describes a violent action that the speaker took, including a direct confrontation with the victim. The phrase ""said 'fuck you bitch'"" introduces a verbal attack, which could be interpreted as insulting language. This is followed by the act of shooting, which is the violent action itself. In terms of communicative acts, the focus is on the verbal interaction that accompanies the action. The utterance does not fit typical categories like Inform (as it is not providing factual information), Request (not asking for anything), or Inquire (not seeking information). It also doesn't fit Desire or Claim as it doesn't express a wish or subjective assertion. The most fitting label is Reject, as the verbal confrontation (""fuck you bitch"") is a clear rejection of the person, intertwined with the act of violence. The politeness dimension is violated through the use of derogatory language, which can be classified under –P [Insult]. There is no need for a meta tag as the utterance is bona fide.",9,93187
Inform,,,"In analyzing the target utterance, the speaker is describing events that occurred after they shot their mother's abusive boyfriend. The utterance provides specific details about their arrest and the fact that there were no witnesses to identify the car, leading to the speaker not revealing their friend's involvement.

Two possible communicative acts to consider here are:
1. **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. The speaker is conveying details about their arrest and the circumstances that led to them not revealing their friend. These details are verifiable and factual in nature.
2. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. However, the statement made by the speaker seems more factual than subjective, as it involves specific events and outcomes that are verifiable.

Given the context, the most fitting label for this utterance is **Inform**, as the speaker is recounting factual events surrounding their arrest and decision not to implicate their friend.

There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance, as it is a straightforward recount of events. Additionally, there are no meta-acts such as sarcasm or reported speech present. Therefore, the annotation should reflect the primary act of informing without additional tags.",10,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""I was charged with murder and sentenced to juvenile life."" is a statement providing factual information about the user's past legal experience. It details the specific charge and the sentence received. The previous utterance discusses the circumstances leading to his arrest, and the next one continues the narrative by explaining the duration and nature of his detention. This context suggests that the user is recounting events in a factual manner. The act that best fits this description is ""Inform,"" as it involves providing verifiable factual information about the user's charge and sentencing. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts in this straightforward factual recounting. Therefore, the annotation should reflect the act of informing.",11,93188
Inform,,,"The target utterance provides factual information about the user's experience after being charged with murder. It details the timeline and nature of their incarceration: spending 2 years in a juvenile detention facility followed by a transfer to a placement facility focused on rehabilitation until their release at 21. This information is specific and verifiable, as it relates to the user's personal history and the legal system's procedures. 

I will consider the following communicative acts:
1. **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information that can be verified. The user is clearly sharing details about their past experience with the juvenile justice system, which fits this category.
2. **Elaborate**: This act involves explaining or paraphrasing a previous utterance. While the user does expand on their previous statement about being sentenced, the primary function of the utterance is to provide new, factual information rather than simply expanding on the previous point.

Considering the options, the **Inform** label is the most fitting as the utterance's primary function is to provide a factual account of the user's experiences in the juvenile justice system. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts, such as sarcasm, in this straightforward narrative. Therefore, the annotation will be labeled accordingly.",12,93187
Invite,,,"The target utterance ""AMA"" is an acronym for ""Ask Me Anything,"" commonly used on platforms like Reddit to invite users to ask questions about the poster's experiences. This suggests that the user, JuvieThrowaw, is opening the floor to inquiries, indicating a willingness to engage and share more about their story. 

Considering the context, where JuvieThrowaw has just shared a significant part of their life story, saying ""AMA"" serves as an invitation for others to interact with him by asking questions. This matches the definition of the ""Invite"" communicative act, as it seeks participation or acceptance from the addressee.

The subsequent message, ""How different was juvy from the rehab place?"" indicates that the invitation was understood and accepted by another user who is asking a question in response. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance, nor is there any sarcasm or non-bona fide communication, so no additional tags are needed.",13,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is a question asking for details about the differences between juvenile detention and a rehabilitation facility. The user is seeking specific information, likely to understand the experiences and challenges faced by the original poster. This aligns with the communicative act of **Inquire**, as the user is requesting factual information or clarification. The context supports this, as it follows an ""Ask Me Anything"" prompt where users are encouraged to ask questions about the original poster's experiences. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm, so these tags are not applicable here.",14,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""Was it hard adjusting to the world once u got out?"" is seeking information from the original poster about their experience. The user is asking a specific question about the difficulty of adjusting to life outside after being released. This fits the definition of an ""Inquire"" act, as it is seeking information that the original poster can provide based on their personal experience. The context supports this interpretation as the previous message also inquires about the differences between juvenile detention and rehabilitation, indicating a pattern of seeking information. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting in this utterance.",15,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance is responding to the previous question about whether it was hard adjusting to the world after being released. The user describes the environment in the juvenile facility, noting that it was more prison-like, though toned down. This provides factual information about the conditions experienced in juvenile detention. The description doesn't express a personal opinion or subjective assertion, so it isn't a ""Claim."" It doesn't give advice, make a request, or ask a question, so it doesn't fit those categories either. Instead, it offers verifiable factual information about the nature of the facility, which aligns with the ""Inform"" communicative act. There's no indication of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any meta-commentary such as sarcasm or reported speech.",16,93187
Inform,,,"In this utterance, the speaker provides additional information about the placement facility they were transferred to after juvenile detention. The comparison to a ""boot camp"" and the clarification that it was ""not as harsh/militaristic"" gives us a specific description of the facility's atmosphere.

1. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is not verifiable in principle. However, the description of the placement facility seems to be a factual account rather than a subjective opinion.

2. **Inform**: This act is about providing verifiable factual information. The speaker is detailing the nature of the placement facility, which can be verified by someone familiar with that type of facility or its policies.

Given that the utterance describes the placement facility's characteristics in a factual manner, it aligns most closely with the **Inform** communicative act. There is no clear expression of politeness or meta-acts in this statement, as it is straightforward factual information without sarcasm or irony.

Thus, the best fitting label for this utterance is **Inform**. There are no politeness or meta-tags applicable here.",17,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""It was hard."" follows a description of the placement facility being like a boot camp. This suggests that ""It was hard."" is a subjective assessment of the experience at the facility. It reflects the speaker's personal perception and emotional response to the environment, rather than providing objective, verifiable information. The utterance is not attempting to direct anyone's behavior, request information, or express a desire. Instead, it is a statement of personal experience, aligning it most closely with the communicative act of Claim, as it conveys the speaker's personal viewpoint or feeling about the difficulty of the situation. The surrounding context, including the next utterance, continues to elaborate on the speaker's personal experience, further supporting the choice of Claim as the appropriate label.",18,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""I was still 14 at heart, since even though I matured,"" involves the speaker reflecting on their personal experience and state of mind. Let's evaluate potential communicative acts:

1. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion, typically unverifiable. The speaker is describing their internal state as being ""14 at heart,"" which is a personal, subjective experience. This reflects an internal perception rather than a factual statement.

2. **Elaborate**: This act involves explaining or paraphrasing a previous utterance. The target utterance does build upon the previous statement ""It was hard,"" by providing context about the speaker's emotional and developmental state at that time. However, the focus is more on expressing the speaker's subjective experience rather than clarifying a point.

3. **Inform**: This act involves providing verifiable factual information. The utterance doesn't fit this category because it discusses a personal, subjective state that cannot be objectively verified.

Given the context, ""I was still 14 at heart, since even though I matured,"" is an expression of personal experience and subjective assertion. This aligns best with the communicative act of **Claim**. The next utterance further elaborates on the speaker's limited understanding of the world, reinforcing the subjective nature of the target utterance.

There are no explicit politeness or meta-acts present in this utterance.

Thus, the most fitting label for this utterance is **Claim**.",19,93187
Claim,,,"In this utterance, the user is reflecting on their personal experience and perspective. The phrase ""I had no idea about the world going on outside"" suggests a lack of awareness or understanding of the world beyond their immediate experience. The statement ""everything I knew was from age 14"" reinforces this by indicating that their knowledge and perspective were limited to what they knew as a 14-year-old. This is a subjective expression of their own perception and understanding.

Possible communicative acts include:

1. **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about their own understanding and perspective at the time. This fits the definition of a claim, as it involves unverifiable personal experience and perception.

2. **Inform**: This could be seen as providing information about their past state of mind, but since it is subjective and based on personal insight, it leans more towards a claim.

Given that the utterance is more about the user's personal insight and subjective perspective, ""Claim"" is the most fitting label. There are no politeness or meta-acts clearly expressed here.

Therefore, the annotation should reflect this understanding.",20,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""How’s your mom doing now?"" is a question posed to the original poster regarding the current condition of their mother. This is a clear example of seeking information, as the user is inquiring about the mother's well-being after the traumatic events described in the background story. The prior message discusses the poster's limited knowledge at a young age, and the next message provides an update on the mother's condition, indicating that the inquiry was addressed. The most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is ""Inquire,"" as it seeks specific information from the original poster. There are no indicators of (non-)politeness in this straightforward question, so the politeness and meta tags are not applicable.",21,93188
Inform,,,"The target utterance is ""She’s a lot better."" The speaker, JuvieThrowaw, is responding to a question about his mother's current well-being. The utterance provides information about her current state, indicating improvement. The statement ""She’s a lot better"" is factual in nature, as it describes a change in condition and can be verified by observing the mother's situation. Therefore, the most appropriate communicative act label for this utterance is ""Inform"" because it provides factual information about the mother's current state. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or irony in this context, so those tags are not applicable here.",22,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""She’s married to a really good guy,"" seems to be providing information about the current situation of the user's sister. The previous message ""She’s a lot better."" indicates a positive change or improvement in her life, which is then elaborated in the target utterance with factual information about her being married to someone who is characterized as a ""really good guy."" 

The next message ""so it all worked out"" ties this information into a broader narrative of resolution or positive outcome. Given this context, the target utterance is best classified as an ""Inform"" act, as it provides verifiable factual information about the sister's marital status and the character of her husband.

There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance, and there are no meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting present. Therefore, the annotation will focus solely on the act of informing.",23,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""so it all worked out"" follows the statement that the speaker's sister is married to a really good guy. The phrase ""it all worked out"" is a subjective assessment of the situation, implying a positive resolution or outcome regarding the sister's life after the abusive situation. This is more of a personal interpretation rather than an objective fact, which suggests that the utterance is a claim. The prior message sets up the context by explaining the sister's current marital status, which the target utterance evaluates as a positive outcome. The next message ""Why does that matter?"" questions the relevance of this information, but it does not affect the classification of the target utterance itself as a claim. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts in the utterance. Therefore, the most fitting label for the target utterance is ""Claim.""",24,93189
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""Why does that matter?"" is a response to the previous message ""so it all worked out."" The user is questioning the relevance or significance of the statement made in the previous message. This suggests an attempt to challenge or dispute the implication that everything turned out well.

In terms of communicative acts, ""Inquire"" is a candidate because the user is asking a question. However, the question seems rhetorical, implying skepticism or disagreement about the idea that things worked out. Thus, ""Reject"" is a more fitting label, as the user is challenging the notion that the situation is resolved positively.

The tone does not display any politeness or impoliteness markers, and there is no indication of sarcasm or non-bona fide communication in this particular utterance. Thus, no politeness or meta tags are needed.

The most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is ""Reject,"" as it challenges the previous statement's implication.",25,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance appears to be a humorous recounting of a situation where the user's stepdad is incredulous about the user's past. The phrase ""Your son is in prison for what now?"" is placed in quotes, indicating it is a reported speech of what the stepdad said. The addition of ""Lol"" at the end suggests that the user is finding humor in the situation or reflecting on the absurdity of it. This implies that the user is not making a subjective assertion but rather reporting someone else's words for comedic effect.

Two possible communicative acts to consider are:
1. **Claim [reported]**: This act involves reporting someone else's words or thoughts, which seems to fit because the user is quoting the stepdad.
2. **React [non-bona fide]**: The user is responding with humor to a potentially serious or awkward situation, which is supported by the use of ""Lol.""

Given the context, the primary act is likely **Claim [reported]** since the user is quoting the stepdad's words directly. However, the use of ""Lol"" indicates a non-serious tone, aligning with the **[non-bona fide]** tag.

Therefore, the best fitting annotation is:
- **Act**: Claim
- **Politeness**: None explicitly present.
- **Meta**: [reported], [non-bona fide] (due to humor indicated by ""Lol"")",26,93188
React,,,"In this context, the target utterance ""lol"" follows a humorous recounting of a new stepdad's reaction to learning about the user's past actions. The ""lol"" is a reaction to the preceding statement, indicating amusement or finding the situation funny. The next message continues by saying that the user and the stepdad have discussed this topic, suggesting that the ""lol"" is not dismissive or negative, but rather a lighthearted acknowledgment of the situation's awkwardness or irony.

Possible communicative acts for ""lol"" in this context include:
1. **React**: Showing engagement or amusement with the previous statement.
2. **Reject**: Dismissing the seriousness of the stepdad's reaction, but this seems less likely given the context of shared humor.

The ""lol"" fits best as a **React** act because it demonstrates the user's amused engagement with the story being told, rather than rejecting or dismissing it. The lighthearted nature of ""lol"" aligns with a positive engagement with the humorous element of the situation.

There is no clear indication of politeness or meta-acts, such as sarcasm, in this specific usage of ""lol"". It's a straightforward response to humor. Thus, the annotation will focus on the React act without additional politeness or meta tags.",27,93188
Inform,,,"The target utterance, ""he and I have actually talked about that,"" appears to be a response to a previous comment or question, possibly regarding a situation or topic that involves another person (""he""). The context provided by the next utterance, ""He was surprised at first, and a little put off,"" suggests a recounting of an interaction or conversation.

Three potential communicative acts could be considered here:

1. **Inform**: The speaker provides factual information about having discussed a particular topic with another person (""he"").
2. **Elaborate**: The speaker could be expanding on a previous statement or question about whether a conversation took place.
3. **Claim**: The assertion that a conversation occurred might be subjective, but it seems factual given the context.

Given the nature of the statement, it fits best as an **Inform** act because it provides specific information about an event (a discussion) that has occurred. The details in the next utterance support this, as they continue to describe the outcome of that discussion. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting, so those aspects are not applicable here.",28,93188
Claim,,,"In this context, the speaker is recounting a past interaction between another person and the speaker's family. The key element of the target utterance is the reaction of the other person, described as being ""surprised"" and ""a little put off."" This is a subjective interpretation of someone else's emotional state or reaction, rather than a factual recounting of specific events or actions. The act of claiming involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, which fits well with the speaker's description of the other person's initial reaction. The utterance does not serve to inform, as it lacks objective factual content that could be verified independently. Instead, it shares a personal perspective on the interaction. There are no clear markers of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance, nor is there any indication of non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",29,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance describes a sequence of events where the speaker's family and family friends explained a situation to an individual, who subsequently changed their stance to support the speaker. The primary communicative act here involves providing information about a past event that led to a change in someone's perspective. This fits the ""Inform"" act, as it provides verifiable factual information about what happened and how it affected the individual's attitude. There is no politeness or meta-act indicated in this straightforward recounting of events.",30,93188
Accept,+P,,"The target utterance ""That's cool,"" is a brief response to the previous message, which mentions that the speaker's family and family friends explained something to someone who then took the speaker's side. The phrase ""That's cool"" is a positive reaction, indicating approval or acceptance of the situation described. 

1. **Accept**: This label is appropriate as the user is expressing agreement or approval of the situation where the family and friends helped make the other person understand and support the speaker. It's a way to show that the outcome is satisfactory or favorable.

2. **React**: This could also fit, as ""That's cool"" is a way to show engagement or a positive reaction to the information given. However, ""React"" is more general and less specific than ""Accept.""

Given the context, ""Accept"" is more precise because the user is explicitly agreeing with or endorsing the outcome described in the previous message. There is no politeness or meta-act evident beyond the simple expression of approval.

The most fitting label is ""Accept"" due to the supportive and agreeing nature of the phrase in this context. There is a slight positive politeness (+P) in acknowledging the positive outcome.",31,93187
Apologize,+N,,"In the target utterance, the user expresses regret or sympathy regarding the situation the original poster found themselves in. The phrase ""I’m sorry"" is indicative of an apology, but in this context, it's not a personal apology for a wrongdoing by the speaker. Instead, it reflects empathy and understanding towards the difficult circumstances described by the original poster. This aligns with the concept of negative politeness (+N), where the speaker is acknowledging the other's negative experience and expressing condolence.

Considering the possible communicative acts:
1. **Apologize**: Typically involves taking responsibility for an action that negatively impacted someone. Here, however, the speaker is not apologizing for their own actions but rather expressing sympathy.
2. **React**: This could involve showing engagement or empathy, but the explicit use of ""I’m sorry"" leans more towards an apology-like expression of empathy than a simple reaction.
3. **Behave**: This act involves calling attention to social norms, which does not fit the context here.

Given the context, ""I’m sorry"" is best interpreted as an empathetic expression, rather than an admission of personal fault. Thus, it aligns with the **Apologize** act due to its language of regret and sympathy, and it carries a negative politeness mark due to its nature of acknowledging the other's negative experience.

Therefore, the most fitting label is **Apologize** with a politeness annotation of **+N**.",32,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance is making a statement about the difficult choice the original poster had to make. It presents a scenario that highlights the severity of the situation faced by the poster. This is not merely an assertion of fact, as it discusses subjective elements, such as the emotional impact and moral dilemma of the situation. The statement does not provide new factual information; rather, it reflects on the emotional and moral complexity of the decision. Therefore, the act of ""Claim"" is most appropriate here, as it involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle. The utterance does not exhibit politeness or impoliteness markers, nor is it reported speech or non-bona fide communication.",33,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""As a young kid your opinions are limited"" appears to make a subjective assertion about the limitations of opinions available to young individuals, particularly in the context of the situation described in the thread. The use of ""your opinions are limited"" suggests that this is an assertion about a general state rather than an objective fact, as it reflects a perspective on how young people may perceive or approach situations.

Considering the communicative acts, ""Claim"" fits this utterance well, as it involves making a subjective assertion. The utterance does not provide verifiable information, nor does it seek information or express a desire. It is not a directive, nor is it a reaction to another statement. It is an assertion based on the user's viewpoint on the limitations of young individuals in making decisions or forming opinions.

There are no clear indications of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance, nor is there any meta-act such as sarcasm or reported speech involved. Therefore, no additional politeness or meta-act tags are needed.

Thus, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",34,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance ""and you did what you had to do"" follows the previous statement, ""As a young kid your opinions are limited."" The speaker seems to be acknowledging or justifying the actions taken by the original poster, suggesting that the actions were necessary given the circumstances. It could be interpreted as a form of acceptance or understanding of the situation. The utterance does not provide new information, nor does it ask for anything or disagree with anything. The phrase ""you did what you had to do"" implies agreement with the necessity of the actions taken by the original poster, thus it aligns with the communicative act of ""Accept.""

The next utterance, ""What parts of growing up did you miss while inside,"" shifts the focus to a different topic, suggesting that the target utterance serves as closure or affirmation of the previous statement rather than leading into the next question.

Therefore, the most appropriate communicative act for the target utterance is ""Accept,"" as it reflects concurrence with the necessity of actions taken by the original poster. There is no clear politeness or meta-act indicated in the target utterance, so those fields remain empty.",35,93188
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""What parts of growing up did you miss while inside,"" is essentially seeking information from the original poster about their personal experiences and reflections during their time in detention. The user is asking a question to understand more about the impact of being in a juvenile facility on the poster's developmental years. This aligns closely with the definition of the ""Inquire"" act, as it is a direct question seeking information from the addressee.

The preceding message, ""and you did what you had to do,"" appears to be a form of acceptance or acknowledgment, but it does not directly influence the communicative act of the target utterance, which stands independently as a question.

The following message, ""and what's your plan to build your future w/o them?"" continues the line of questioning, further supporting the idea that the target utterance is an inquiry.

Thus, the communicative act for the target utterance is best labeled as ""Inquire,"" as it seeks specific information from the poster. There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting, so those aspects are not applicable here.",36,93188
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is a continuation of the previous question, asking the original poster to reflect on their past experiences and future plans. The primary goal of the utterance is to seek information about two different aspects: what parts of growing up the user missed while being incarcerated and how they plan to build their future without those experiences.

Possible communicative acts for this utterance include:
1. **Inquire**: The utterance is structured as a question, seeking information from the original poster about their past and future plans.
2. **Request**: Although it is seeking information, it is not asking for an action to be taken but rather for information to be provided, which aligns more with inquiry.

Given the context where the user was previously asked about the parts they missed while growing up, the target utterance adds a second part to the question, focusing on future plans. This supports the interpretation of it being an inquiry. There is no evidence of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is **Inquire** because it seeks specific information from the poster. There are no additional politeness or meta tags applicable in this context.",37,93190
Claim,,,"In this context, the user ""JuvieThrowaw"" is responding to a question about their plan for the future after serving time. The target utterance expresses a personal sentiment about a significant life event they feel they missed, which is watching their sister grow up. The statement is subjective and reflects an emotional or personal perspective rather than a factual recounting. The act of expressing personal feelings or experiences typically falls under the ""Claim"" category, as it's unverifiable in principle and reflects the speaker's perspective or emotions. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-tags like sarcasm here.

Considering the options:
1. **Claim** – The user shares a personal feeling about missing out on his sister's growth, which is subjective.
2. **Inform** – Less likely because the utterance does not provide verifiable factual information.

Given the subjective nature of the utterance, ""Claim"" is the most fitting act.

No politeness or meta-act markers are present, as the statement doesn't show any form of politeness, impoliteness, or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm. Therefore, we don't need to annotate those.

Thus, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",38,93187
Inform,,,"In the provided context, the user is reflecting on their relationship with their little sister during their time in juvenile detention. The previous utterance mentions missing out on watching the sister grow up, and the target utterance provides additional information about their relationship, specifically that they remained very close because the sister and mother visited frequently. The next utterance continues the sentiment of regret about missing out on important years.

Considering the communicative acts:
1. **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about the continued closeness with the sister and mother's visits, which is verifiable.
2. **Elaborate**: It could also be seen as elaborating on the previous statement about missing out, by explaining how they managed to stay close despite the circumstances.

The primary act here seems to be **Inform**, as the user is sharing a factual detail about how they maintained a close relationship with their sister and mother through visits, which contrasts with the regret expressed in the surrounding utterances.

There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm in this utterance. Therefore, the focus is on the provision of factual information.

Based on this analysis, the label **Inform** is most appropriate.",39,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""But I just can’t help but feel bad for missing her formative years."" expresses an emotional state regarding a past event. It reflects a personal feeling of regret or sadness for not being present during a significant period in his sister's life. The use of ""can't help but feel bad"" indicates an internal, subjective experience rather than an objective fact. 

Considering the communicative acts, the most fitting label is ""Claim"" because the speaker is making a subjective assertion about his feelings, which are unverifiable and personal. This utterance is not providing factual information (which would be ""Inform""), nor is it seeking information (""Inquire""). It is also not directing action or engaging in any other communicative act like apologizing or elaborating on a previous point. 

Therefore, the act of claiming personal feelings fits best. Additionally, there are no clear indications of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance, as it is a straightforward expression of sentiment without addressing another person directly. No meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting are present.",40,93187
Inform,,,"In this context, the speaker is reflecting on their relationship with their sister after having been absent during her formative years due to their time in detention. The target utterance, ""We are still close and hang out a lot, so I guess it’s a rebuilt,"" is providing information about their current relationship status with their sister. The use of ""rebuild"" suggests that the relationship may have been damaged or lost at some point and has since been restored.

Possible communicative acts include:
1. **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about the current state of their relationship with their sister.
2. **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their relationship status, which is partly unverifiable as it depends on personal perception.

Given the context, the most fitting act is **Inform**, as the speaker is stating a verifiable fact about how they currently have a close relationship and spend time with their sister, indicating a rebuilding of their bond. There is no clear politeness or meta-act in this utterance, so those remain empty.",41,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is a question: ""Do you still have a relationship with your mom?"" This is a clear example of seeking information, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Inquire."" The user is asking the original poster (OP) about their current relationship status with their mother. This follows the previous statement about rebuilding relationships and precedes another question about mental health. There are no indicators of politeness or impoliteness in the question, nor is there any sarcasm or reporting of another's speech. Therefore, the act is ""Inquire,"" and there are no additional politeness or meta tags to apply.",42,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is asking about the original poster's current mental health after experiencing a traumatic past. The primary function of this utterance is to seek information about the poster's mental state, which fits the ""Inquire"" act. The context provided by the previous and next utterances indicates that the user is engaged in a conversation about the effects of their past experiences on their present life. There is no evidence of politeness or impoliteness markers, nor is there any non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or humor in the inquiry. Therefore, the utterance is best categorized as an ""Inquire"" act without any additional politeness or meta tags.",43,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""We’ve had ups and downs."" is a response to the previous inquiry about the user's mental health after experiencing traumatic events. The user provides a subjective assertion about their mental health status, indicating variability over time. This does not provide specific factual information but rather a personal perspective on their mental state. Therefore, the most fitting communicative act is ""Claim,"" as it reflects the user's personal experience and feelings, which are subjective and not verifiable. There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts in the utterance.",44,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""As I got around 17/18, I started to learn about the world,"" is essentially describing a personal experience or change in understanding that occurred at a specific age. It involves the speaker reflecting on their own growth and learning process. This kind of statement is subjective and centers on the speaker's personal perspective and internal development. 

The most fitting communicative act for this utterance is ""Claim,"" as it involves a subjective assertion about the speaker's own experiences and feelings. It is not providing verifiable factual information (which would be ""Inform""), nor is it trying to engage the listener in any directive or inquiry. The utterance is more about sharing a personal revelation or introspection, which aligns well with the definition of ""Claim.""

No politeness or meta-acts are explicitly present in this utterance, as it is a straightforward reflection without any sarcasm, irony, or reported speech. Therefore, the annotation will focus solely on the communicative act itself.",45,93187
Claim,,,"In this utterance, the speaker is expressing their emotional reaction towards their mother's past advice to ignore the abusive situation. The key part of the utterance is ""which made me really angry at my mom for telling us to ignore it."" This is a subjective assertion about the speaker's feelings towards their mother's actions. Such expressions of personal emotions typically fall under the ""Claim"" category since they are subjective and cannot be objectively verified. The speaker is not seeking information, providing factual data, or directly addressing another user's statements, which rules out other categories like ""Inquire,"" ""Inform,"" or ""Reject."" Additionally, there is no politeness or meta component that stands out in this utterance. Therefore, the most fitting communicative act for this utterance is ""Claim.""",46,93187
Elaborate,,,"The target utterance ""putting my sister and I’s health at risk"" is an extension of the previous statement, where the user expresses anger towards their mother for telling them to ignore the abusive situation. This utterance elaborates on the reason for the anger, emphasizing the consequence of the mother's actions—risk to their health. The user is explaining why they felt the way they did, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Elaborate."" It extends the previous thought by specifying the negative impact of the mother's advice to ignore the abuse. Other possible labels could be ""Claim,"" as the risk is a subjective assertion, but given that it is directly expanding on the previous sentence, ""Elaborate"" is more fitting. There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm. Therefore, the most appropriate label is ""Elaborate.""",47,93187
Inform,,,"In this context, the speaker is describing a past situation where their mother put their health at risk but is now very apologetic about it. The key part of the target utterance is ""She is very apologetic about it, and we rebuild our relationship."" 

The communicative act here revolves around the mother's feelings and actions. The speaker is conveying that the mother has expressed regret for her past actions and is working on rebuilding the relationship. This involves acknowledging the mother's apology, which is related to a humble or self-deprecating act. However, the speaker is not directly apologizing themselves, so the act of ""Apologize"" does not fit.

Instead, the speaker is providing factual information about the current state of their relationship with their mother, which is a shift from the previous state of risk to a more positive one. This aligns with the ""Inform"" communicative act, as the speaker is relaying verifiable information about the mother's current behavior and the status of their relationship.

Thus, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Inform."" There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting in this context.",48,93189
Claim,,,"In this context, the user is responding to a presumed question or comment about whether it is normal for the relationship with their mother to be rebuilt after her apologetic behavior. The phrase ""so no I’d say it is pretty normal"" is used to assert an opinion about the normalcy of the situation.

1. **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about their perception of the situation as normal. This is a personal opinion that cannot be objectively verified, fitting the definition of a claim.

2. **Accept**: Could be considered if this were a direct response agreeing with someone else's assertion about normalcy. However, without direct evidence of such a statement preceding this, it seems more like an independent assertion rather than agreement.

3. **React**: Possible if interpreted as a reaction to someone else’s statement, but the structure ""so no I’d say"" indicates more of an evaluative statement than a simple reaction.

Given the context, the most appropriate label is **Claim**, as the user is expressing a personal belief about the normalcy of their relationship dynamics. There is no clear indication of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.",49,93187
Apologize,+N,,"The target utterance ""I don’t mean to sound like a cold and unemotional person,"" is a preface to the user's subsequent statement. It serves to mitigate any potential negative perception that might arise from what follows. This is an example of hedging, where the speaker is trying to minimize the potential for offense by acknowledging how their forthcoming words might be interpreted. This aligns with the concept of negative politeness, where the speaker is concerned about imposing on the listener or being perceived negatively. The act here is not to provide factual information or to inquire, but rather to manage the impression given by the following statement. Therefore, the best label for this utterance is an instance of negative politeness. The most fitting communicative-act label is ""Apologize"" as the speaker is humbling themselves by recognizing how they might come across. The politeness annotation is ""+N"" for negative politeness.",50,93187
Claim,+N,,"The target utterance is part of a reflection on the user's past experiences, specifically addressing their mental health. Let's consider some potential communicative acts:

1. **Claim**: The user is expressing a personal, subjective viewpoint about their mental health. They assert that their mental health wasn't significantly affected except for feeling sad due to specific circumstances.

2. **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about their mental state. However, since mental health is subjective and the statement is about personal feelings, it leans more towards a claim than verifiable information.

3. **Elaborate**: The utterance builds on the previous sentence, which mentions not wanting to sound unemotional. The user elaborates on why they might seem that way by explaining their mental health situation.

Between these options, ""Claim"" fits best as the user is making a subjective assertion about their mental health. The politeness aspect is also notable; the user starts with a hedge, ""I don’t mean to sound like a cold and unemotional person,"" which indicates an attempt to mitigate any negative impression. This is a form of negative politeness (+N), which involves hedging to avoid sounding too blunt or harsh.

Therefore, the utterance is best labeled as a ""Claim"" with a politeness marker of ""+N"".",51,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""I’m not sure, it’s hard to explain."" needs to be analyzed in context. The previous utterance discusses the user's mental health and feelings of sadness due to being unable to see their family. The target utterance seems to reflect on the difficulty of articulating those feelings or experiences. It doesn't provide new factual information or a directive, nor does it inquire or react to anything specific. The phrase ""I’m not sure"" indicates uncertainty or difficulty in expressing something clearly.

Two possible communicative acts come to mind:
1. **Desire**: Expressing a hope or speculation about being able to explain, but feeling unable to.
2. **Claim**: Making a subjective assertion about their own feelings or state of mind.

Between these, the Claim seems more fitting because the utterance is a subjective statement about the speaker's internal state, not an expression of hope or speculation. It conveys the difficulty in articulating feelings, which is inherently subjective.

There is no politeness or meta-act clearly present in this utterance. It does not express positive or negative politeness, nor does it involve any reported speech or non-bona fide language.

Therefore, the best fitting label for this utterance is Claim.",52,93188
Apologize,,,"The target utterance ""I’m sorry you went thru this.."" appears to be an expression of empathy and sympathy towards the original poster's difficult situation. The phrase ""I’m sorry"" is a common way to express regret or sympathy for someone else's misfortune or hardship. This aligns closely with the communicative act of ""Apologize,"" as it involves humbling oneself and expressing a sentiment of regret, even if the speaker is not personally responsible for the situation. The context provided in the previous message, ""I’m not sure, it’s hard to explain,"" doesn't offer much additional information that would sway the interpretation away from this being an expression of sympathy. The next message suggests looking at the positive side, which may indicate an attempt to provide emotional support, but it does not alter the interpretation of the target utterance. Additionally, the phrase does not involve any specific politeness or meta-acts beyond the expression of sympathy itself. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Apologize.""",53,93187
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance ""count it as a blessing that your mental health has been good!"" can be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it could be seen as a directive, as it is advising the original poster to consider their mental health as a blessing. However, it's not a strong command but more of a suggestion or a gentle encouragement. 

Another possibility is that it could be seen as a congratulatory statement, expressing a positive sentiment about the original poster's mental health status. The phrase ""count it as a blessing"" is often used to highlight something positive or fortunate, which aligns with the congratulatory act. 

Given the context, where the previous utterance expresses sympathy and the next one offers support through prayer, the congratulatory interpretation fits well as it maintains a tone of positivity and support. 

The utterance does not contain clear politeness or meta-acts markers, such as sarcasm or irony. Therefore, the most fitting label is ""Congratulate,"" with no additional politeness or meta-act annotations needed.",54,93187
Desire,+P,,"The target utterance ""Keeping you in my prayer❤️"" expresses a form of well-wishing or positive sentiment towards the original poster. It's not seeking information, providing factual information, or directing any action. Instead, it falls under the category of expressing a hope or wish, which aligns with the ""Desire"" label in the communicative-act taxonomy. The use of the heart emoji further emphasizes the supportive and positive nature of the message. This is a common expression of emotional support in digital communication.

Additionally, there is an element of positive politeness here, as the speaker is showing care and solidarity with the addressee by saying they will keep them in their prayers. This is a way of expressing empathy and support, which enhances the positive sentiment of the utterance.

Thus, the most fitting communicative-act label for this utterance is ""Desire"" with a positive politeness marker.",55,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""It is abusive that your mother kept you in that situation"" can be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it could be seen as a **Claim**, where the speaker is making a subjective assertion about the situation being abusive. This fits as it's an evaluation that reflects the user's opinion about the mother's actions. Another possibility is **Reject**, as it indirectly criticizes the mother's decision to keep the user in that situation, indicating disapproval. However, it's not explicitly rejecting any prior statement, so it doesn't fit perfectly.

The context of the prior message, ""Keeping you in my prayer❤️,"" suggests a supportive tone, and the next message, ""and I don't blame you for what you did,"" further indicates an understanding and non-judgmental stance. This means the utterance is likely part of a supportive discourse, reinforcing the Claim as the most suitable label. The tone is not overtly impolite or polite, hence no additional politeness markers are needed.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is **Claim**, as it communicates the user's perspective on the described abuse without directly contradicting or rejecting any previous claims. There are no explicit politeness or meta-acts present in the utterance.",56,93187
Accept,+P,,"The target utterance ""and I don't blame you for what you did."" follows a statement about the abusiveness of the user's mother's decision to keep them in a harmful situation. The utterance expresses understanding and support for the user's actions in response to the abuse. The phrase ""I don't blame you"" implies acceptance and agreement with the user's decision to act as they did, given the circumstances. This aligns with the act of ""Accept,"" as the speaker is showing agreement with the user's past actions. The utterance is supportive, indicating positive engagement, which can be considered positive politeness. Therefore, the most suitable communicative-act label is ""Accept"" with a politeness tag of ""+P.""",57,93187
React,+P,,"In the context of the conversation, the target utterance ""I'm glad you two have patched things up."" follows a supportive comment and precedes a well-wishing message. The speaker expresses a positive sentiment about the fact that ""you two have patched things up,"" indicating that some form of reconciliation or resolution has occurred. The phrase ""I'm glad"" suggests an emotional reaction to this resolution, which aligns with the communicative act of expressing pleasure or satisfaction with a situation. 

I considered the possible communicative acts:
1. **React**: This act involves showing engagement, which could fit as the speaker is reacting positively to the resolution mentioned.
2. **Congratulate**: This act expresses praise or good wishes, which might seem applicable due to the positive tone, but it is more about expressing happiness for a resolution than congratulating on an achievement.

Ultimately, the utterance is not explicitly praising or congratulating; rather, it is expressing a positive reaction to a situation, which aligns best with the **React** act. There is no additional layer of sarcasm or irony, so no meta-act is applicable. The expression of positive sentiment could be considered positive politeness, as it fosters goodwill and rapport.

Given this reasoning, the most fitting label is **React** with positive politeness.",58,93187
Desire,+P,,"The target utterance ""I wish you nothing but the best in the future!"" expresses a positive sentiment and hope for the addressee's future. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Desire,"" as it involves expressing a wish or hope. The sentiment is clearly supportive and positive, which could be interpreted as positive politeness (+P) due to the expression of goodwill and solidarity. The surrounding context, where the previous utterance mentions gladness about reconciliation (""I'm glad you two have patched things up""), supports the interpretation that the speaker is offering well-wishes in light of a positive development. The next utterance does not directly affect the interpretation of the target utterance, as it introduces a new topic regarding work in domestic violence (""I used to work in dv.""). Thus, the most fitting annotation for this utterance is ""Desire"" with a positive politeness tag.",59,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""I used to work in dv."" is a factual statement about the speaker's past experience. It provides information about the user's background related to the topic of domestic violence (dv). The surrounding context, with a prior message wishing the original poster well and a subsequent message discussing difficult choices, suggests that the user is contributing to the discussion by drawing on their professional experience. This aligns with the act of ""Inform,"" as it is providing verifiable information that could be confirmed by the user's employment history. There are no indicators of (non-)politeness in the utterance, and it is not a reported or non-bona fide statement. Therefore, the best-fitting label is ""Inform.""",60,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Often ones choices are shitty or shittier"" appears to be making a general observation about the nature of choices in a difficult situation, possibly related to domestic violence (dv) as mentioned in the previous context. The user is likely reflecting on the limited options available to those in abusive situations.

1. **Claim**: This utterance could be seen as a claim, as it is a subjective assertion based on the speaker's experience or perspective. It's not presenting verifiable information but rather a general statement about the nature of choices.

2. **Inform**: Alternatively, it could be an attempt to inform, providing a factual statement based on the user's experience in the field of domestic violence. However, given that the statement is more of a generalization rather than specific factual information, this seems less likely.

3. **Elaborate**: It could also be elaborating on the previous statement about working in domestic violence, providing further insight into the nature of the work or the situations encountered.

Considering these options, the most fitting label is **Claim**, as it aligns with making a subjective assertion about the nature of choices in difficult situations. There is no clear indication of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.",61,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance ""No good choices there."" appears to be an evaluation or commentary on the situation being discussed. The prior message states, ""Often ones choices are shitty or shittier,"" which implies a recognition of limited or poor options. The target utterance reinforces this sentiment by stating that there are ""No good choices there,"" essentially agreeing with the notion of having poor options.

Two possible communicative acts could apply here: 

1. **Accept**: This act would involve agreeing with the prior statement. The target does seem to be in agreement with the sentiment expressed in the previous utterance about the lack of good choices.

2. **Claim**: This act would involve making a subjective assertion. The target is asserting that there are ""No good choices there,"" which is a subjective perspective on the situation.

Upon closer examination, the target utterance aligns more with an **Accept** act. It serves as a concurrence with the previous statement that choices are between ""shitty or shittier."" Therefore, the primary act is to agree with the sentiment expressed in the previous utterance.

There is no indication of politeness or a meta-act in this utterance, as it is a straightforward agreement.",62,93187
React,+P,,"In the target utterance, ""I’m glad you are relatively good,"" the user is expressing a positive sentiment towards the well-being of another person. The phrase ""I’m glad"" indicates satisfaction or happiness about the state of the person being referred to. This aligns with the communicative act of ""React,"" as it shows engagement and a positive response to the situation.

Other possible acts like ""Congratulate"" or ""Thank"" do not fit as well because there is no achievement being praised or gratitude being expressed. The statement is more about acknowledging and reacting to the person's current state.

The prior context, ""No good choices there,"" suggests a difficult situation or limited options, which makes the target utterance a positive acknowledgment of the person's relative well-being despite the circumstances. The next utterance, ""I wish that our systems were more fictional and helped people,"" doesn't directly relate to the target in terms of communicative act, as it shifts the focus to a desire for systemic change.

Overall, ""React"" is the most fitting label for the target utterance, as it captures the user's engagement and positive sentiment towards the other person's condition. There is an element of positive politeness (+P) in expressing gladness about someone's well-being.",63,93187
Desire,,,"The target utterance ""I wish that our systems were more fictional and helped people"" expresses a desire for the systems (likely social systems or services) to be more effective in helping people. The phrase ""I wish"" indicates a desire or hope for something that is not currently the case. The speaker is expressing a counterfactual wish about the current state of systems, suggesting they are not as helpful as they could be. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Desire,"" which is used when a speaker expresses a want, hope, or speculation. The context of the previous message being about being relatively good and the next message being about self-care in social services further supports that this is an expression of a wish for improvement in systems related to social services. There are no clear indicators of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any use of sarcasm or reported speech.",64,93187
Direct,,,"The target utterance, ""Self care is the best thing you can do for yourself in working in social services,"" appears to be providing advice or a suggestion to someone working in social services. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Direct,"" as it attempts to cause action by advising the importance of self-care. 

Let's consider other possible labels:
1. **Inform**: The utterance could be seen as informing someone about the importance of self-care. However, the phrasing ""the best thing you can do"" suggests a prescriptive intent rather than merely providing information.
2. **Claim**: It could be a subjective assertion about self-care, but the context suggests more of an advisory tone.

Given the context, the next utterance advises on the limitations of repairing the world, further supporting the idea that the target utterance is part of a series of practical advice. Therefore, ""Direct"" is the most fitting label, as the speaker is advising the reader to take care of themselves.

No explicit politeness or meta-acts are present in the target utterance.",65,93190
Claim,,,"The target utterance is reflective and provides a perspective on working in social services. It suggests that while one may not be able to fix everything (""repair the world""), they can still have a positive impact on individuals. This statement does not seek information or direct action, nor does it respond directly to another user's comment. Instead, it makes a subjective assertion about the limitations and potential of social service work.

Possible communicative acts include ""Claim"" and ""Inform."" However, ""Inform"" typically involves providing verifiable factual information, whereas this utterance is more about expressing a belief or perspective, which aligns with ""Claim."" The speaker shares their viewpoint on the nature of their work, which is subjective and unverifiable in principle.

The utterance is not sarcastic, humorous, or involve reported speech, so no meta-acts are needed. There are no explicit markers of politeness or impoliteness.

Therefore, the best fit for this utterance is ""Claim.""",66,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance by ""hickgorilla"" is reflective and discusses the act of listening as a powerful tool, despite it being painful. Let's evaluate potential communicative acts:

1. **Claim**: This is a subjective assertion about the nature of listening. The speaker is sharing their perspective on listening as a powerful tool, which is inherently subjective and based on personal understanding.
   
2. **Elaborate**: The speaker could be expanding on the previous utterance's idea of making small changes for individuals, by suggesting that listening is one such small yet powerful change.

3. **Inform**: The speaker is providing a statement that could be interpreted as factual within the context of personal advice or wisdom, though it is more subjective than objective.

Given the context, the speaker's utterance aligns most closely with **Claim**. The statement is a personal assertion about listening, expressing a subjective viewpoint rather than providing objective information or expanding on the prior statement in a way that adds factual detail.

There is no clear politeness or meta-act in this utterance. The use of ""fucking"" could be seen as an emphasis on the difficulty of listening, but it doesn't alter the core communicative act of making a claim.

Therefore, the most appropriate act for this utterance is ""Claim"".",67,93187
Desire,+P,,"The target utterance ""I wish you the best"" follows a message about listening being a powerful but painful tool. This is often said as a sign of goodwill or support. Let's evaluate potential labels:

1. **Desire**: This label is used for expressions of want, hope, speculation, or promise. ""I wish you the best"" is a clear expression of hope for someone's future or circumstances, indicating a desire for positive outcomes for the addressee.

2. **Congratulate**: This involves expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement. While ""I wish you the best"" contains good wishes, it doesn't reference any specific achievement, so this doesn't fit well.

3. **Thank**: This is used to express gratitude, which doesn't apply here as there is no gratitude being expressed.

Given the context of the surrounding messages, ""I wish you the best"" is best categorized as an expression of hope or desire for positive outcomes, fitting the **Desire** label. There is a positive politeness aspect in the expression of goodwill, but the main act is Desire.

Therefore, the most appropriate label is ""Desire"" with positive politeness.",68,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""How's your relationship with your sister now?"" is seeking information from the original poster about the current state of their relationship with their sister. This is a straightforward inquiry, as the user is asking a direct question to obtain information. Other possible communicative acts could be ""Request"" if it was seeking an action or ""React"" if it was showing engagement, but neither fits as well as ""Inquire"" because the main purpose is to obtain information about the relationship. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts in this inquiry, as it is a simple, factual question without sarcasm or reported speech.",69,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""Is she/has she been ok?"" is a question directed towards the original poster, seeking information about the well-being of the poster's sister. The user is inquiring about the current state or past condition of the sister, indicating a concern for her situation. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Inquire,"" as it is a straightforward request for information. There is no indication of sarcasm, humor, or any politeness markers that would suggest a different label or add a politeness/meta-act tag.",70,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Me and my sister are very close."" is a response to the previous question, ""Is she/has she been ok?"" This question is likely inquiring about the state of the speaker's sister and their relationship. The target utterance provides subjective information about the relationship between the speaker and their sister, indicating their closeness. This is a subjective assertion about their relationship and is not verifiable in principle, making it a clear example of the ""Claim"" communicative act.

The next utterance, ""They visited me a lot so our relationship never really soured,"" elaborates on why they remain close, providing additional context to the claim. However, the target utterance itself is focused on expressing the state of their relationship in terms of closeness, which fits the ""Claim"" category.

There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance. The statement is straightforward and does not express any politeness strategies or non-bona fide communication like sarcasm or irony.

Thus, the most appropriate label for the target utterance is ""Claim.""",71,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""They visited me a lot so our relationship never really soured."" is providing information about the frequency of visits and the impact on the relationship between the user and their sister. The user is explaining why their relationship remained strong, which is factual in nature. 

Considering possible communicative acts:
1. **Inform**: The user is giving verifiable information about the visits and the relationship's status.
2. **Elaborate**: The user might be expanding on the previous statement about being very close with their sister by explaining how their relationship remained close.

The utterance is best categorized as **Inform** because it provides factual details about the visits and their positive effect on the relationship. The prior message supports that they are talking about their close relationship, and the target utterance explains why it remained that way. The next message continues to inform by mentioning the sister's current status. Therefore, the primary communicative act is providing factual information rather than elaborating on a previous statement.

No politeness or meta-act markers are present, as the utterance is straightforward and factual.",72,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""She’s doing very well"" is part of a sequence discussing the user's sister. The previous message indicates a continued positive relationship with the family, and the next message provides additional information about the sister's current status: ""now she’s about to graduate from college.""

Potential communicative acts for the target utterance include:

1. **Inform**: This act would apply if the utterance is providing verifiable information about the sister's well-being.
2. **Claim**: This act would apply if the utterance is expressing a subjective opinion or perspective on the sister's situation.

Given the context, ""She’s doing very well"" is a statement about the sister's current state, which is supported by the next utterance about her impending graduation from college. This suggests that the user is sharing factual information about her achievements and current status, even though ""doing well"" can be subjective. However, the phrase is presented as an update on her status, aligning more with an **Inform** act.

The target utterance does not exhibit any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness, nor does it contain any meta-acts like reporting or sarcasm.

Therefore, the most fitting label is **Inform**.",73,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""now she’s about to graduate from college."" is providing specific information about someone's status, likely referring to the sister mentioned in the context. The previous message ""She’s doing very well"" is also indicative of sharing factual information about the sister's current condition. The target sentence directly follows with more concrete and verifiable information that enhances the previous statement about her well-being. The next message ""Thats awesome!"" is a reaction to the positive information provided, reinforcing the interpretation that the target utterance is informative rather than a claim or any other act. Therefore, the most appropriate label for the target utterance is ""Inform"" as it provides factual information. There is no clear indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm in this context.",74,93187
React,+P,,"The target utterance ""Thats awesome!"" is a reaction to the previous statement about someone graduating from college. This utterance expresses a positive engagement and acknowledgment of the preceding information. The most fitting communicative act label for this is ""React,"" as it shows listenership and engagement, particularly positive engagement. It does not provide new information, inquire, or direct action, and it is not an acceptance or rejection of an idea. There's a positive undertone, as the speaker expresses enthusiasm or admiration for the achievement mentioned, but it does not qualify as ""Congratulate"" because it lacks direct praise or well-wishing specifically directed at the individual's achievement. Therefore, ""React"" is the most suitable label, with an added positive politeness marker to reflect the supportive tone.",75,93187
Desire,+P,,"The target utterance ""Hope you succeed in whatever ventures you take!"" is an expression of a wish or hope for the future. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Desire,"" which involves expressing wants, hopes, or speculations. The context, with a prior supportive message (""Thats awesome!"") and a subsequent inquiry about regret, suggests that the user is showing positive engagement and encouragement towards the original poster. There is no indication of sarcasm or irony, so no meta-act is needed. The politeness expressed is positive, as the user is offering a supportive and encouraging sentiment. Therefore, the label for the act is ""Desire"" with a positive politeness marker (+P).",76,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""Do you regret shooting him?"" is an inquiry. The user ElzaPrivate is seeking information from the original poster, specifically about their emotional state or feelings regarding the shooting incident. The previous message is a supportive message wishing success, which does not directly relate to the target utterance but sets a neutral or positive tone. The next message provides a direct response to the inquiry, indicating that the question was indeed seeking information. The act of inquiring aligns well with the definition of seeking information. Therefore, the most fitting communicative act label for the target utterance is ""Inquire."" There are no clear indicators of politeness or impoliteness in this straightforward question, so no additional tags are required.",77,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""In terms of emotionally, no."" is a response to the question ""Do you regret shooting him?"" The user is expressing a lack of emotional regret for their action. This expression of a subjective feeling or emotional state fits the definition of a ""Claim,"" as it is a personal assertion that is unverifiable in principle. The user is not providing any factual information, nor are they agreeing or disagreeing with another statement; they are simply stating their own emotional stance regarding the situation. Therefore, ""Claim"" is the most appropriate communicative-act label for this utterance. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this straightforward response.",78,93189
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""He was abusive and cruel."" is a statement that provides information about the mother's boyfriend, describing his character and actions. The user is offering factual information based on his own experience, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Inform."" The context supports this interpretation as the previous and next utterances reflect on the user's emotional and personal experiences, with the target utterance fitting into this narrative by explaining the reasons behind the user's actions and feelings. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reported speech, so those tags are not applicable here.",79,93187
Desire,,,"The target utterance, ""But I do regret not being able to see my sister grow up,"" is an expression of personal feelings and reflection on past actions. The user is expressing a sense of remorse and regret. The use of ""I do regret"" indicates that the speaker is reflecting on their past actions and the consequences it had on their life, particularly missing out on important life events such as seeing their sister grow up. This aligns with the communicative act of expressing a Desire, as it involves expressing a wish or hope that things could have been different. The statement is focused on the speaker's personal feelings and is subjective, making it a Claim as well. However, the emphasis on regret and the implicit wish for a different past suggests Desire is more appropriate. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting in this context. Therefore, the best label for this utterance is Desire.",80,93189
Apologize,,,"The target utterance expresses the user's feelings of regret about the impact of their actions on the family of the person they shot. This is an expression of remorse or regret, which aligns with the act of ""Apologize."" The speaker is not directly apologizing to the family, but they are acknowledging the negative consequences of their actions on others, which is a form of self-deprecation or expressing humility about the situation. The surrounding context shows that the user is reflecting on the past and the various effects of their actions, but the focus in the target utterance is on the regret for traumatizing the family, which fits well with an apologetic or remorseful tone. Therefore, the most appropriate communicative act label for the target utterance is ""Apologize."" There is no clear expression of politeness or meta-acts in this specific utterance.",81,93193
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""but I don’t feel bad for doing it to him…"" follows the previous message where the user expresses regret for traumatizing the family of the person he shot. The use of ""but"" indicates a contrast to the regret expressed earlier, showing a shift in focus to the user’s feelings about the individual he shot. This utterance expresses the user's personal feelings and subjective stance towards the action he took against the abusive boyfriend.

There are a few possible communicative acts to consider:

1. **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about his own feelings, which are inherently unverifiable by others. This fits the definition of a claim, as it is about his personal emotional state.

2. **Reject**: The user could be rejecting the expectation or societal norm that he should feel remorse for the act. However, the focus is more on his own feelings rather than a direct opposition to an external statement or norm.

3. **React**: This could be seen as a reaction in terms of expressing an emotional response, but it is more deeply an expression of personal belief or stance, making ""Claim"" a more fitting label.

Given the context and the nature of the utterance, ""Claim"" is the most appropriate label. There are no explicit politeness or impoliteness markers in this utterance, as it is a straightforward expression of personal sentiment without addressing another person or using any hedging, sarcasm, or aggressive language. Therefore, no additional politeness or meta-acts are necessary.

The best fitting label is ""Claim"" as the user is expressing a subjective assertion regarding his feelings about the event.",82,93187
Accept,+P,,"The target utterance ""I don’t blame you for what you did."" is a response to the previous message where the original poster expressed not feeling bad for shooting the abusive boyfriend. The phrase ""I don’t blame you"" indicates agreement or acceptance of the action taken by the original poster. It suggests understanding and support for the decision made under the circumstances described. The user is not expressing disagreement or challenging the action but rather showing empathy and understanding.

Considering the communicative act labels, ""Accept"" is the most fitting label as it aligns with agreeing or concurring with the original poster's sentiment. This is not an expression of desire, an inquiry, or any directive; it's a supportive acknowledgment of the original poster's actions.

Additionally, there is a positive politeness element here as the user is showing empathy and understanding, which aligns with positive politeness strategies. However, since the main act is accepting the decision, the primary focus remains on the ""Accept"" label.",83,93189
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance ""I’m glad you are out now."" is a response to the previous comment, ""I don’t blame you for what you did."" The speaker, _the_chosen_juan_, expresses positive sentiment towards the original poster's current situation, having been released after serving time. This is not an acceptance or agreement of the previous statement but an expression of positive emotion towards the current status of the original poster.

The possible communicative acts could be:
1. **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes, which fits the context of being glad about someone's release.
2. **React**: Showing engagement or positive response, but typically more neutral or less specific than congratulating.
3. **Thank**: Expressing gratitude, but this doesn't fit as there's no indication of gratitude in the statement.

Between the options, ""Congratulate"" seems most fitting as it expresses positive regard for the person's release, akin to expressing good wishes for their achievement of being out now. The reaction from the next comment reinforces the genuineness and empathy of the statement, supporting that it's more than a simple reaction but a congratulatory sentiment.

Therefore, the most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is ""Congratulate,"" with an emphasis on the positive expression of goodwill. There's no clear politeness or meta-act markers specifically present, so those fields will remain empty.",84,93188
React,+P,,"The target utterance expresses an evaluation of the previous message, describing it as ""the most genuine and truly empathetic response"" the speaker could imagine. This suggests a strong positive reaction to the previous user's comment, indicating appreciation or approval. 

1. **Potential Acts:**
   - **React:** The utterance shows engagement with the previous message, emphasizing the emotional impact of the response.
   - **Thank:** It could be interpreted as a form of gratitude, but it lacks explicit language of appreciation like ""thank you.""

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The previous message is a supportive statement, ""I’m glad you are out now,"" which the target response praises for its genuineness and empathy.
   - The next message, ""You're a good person, OP,"" continues the theme of positive affirmation towards the original poster.

3. **Narrowing Down:**
   - **React** seems more fitting than **Thank** because the utterance does not directly express gratitude; instead, it focuses on the emotional resonance of the previous message.
   - There is no explicit politeness marker, but the positivity of the comment could be seen as positive politeness in terms of solidarity.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - The act is **React** due to the expression of engagement and positive emotional response to the previous message.
   - Politeness is **+P** because it conveys a positive sentiment and strengthens social bonds.

Therefore, the best label for this utterance is React with positive politeness.",85,93187
Congratulate,+P,,"The target utterance ""You're a good person, OP"" is a statement made by the user cbsixx in response to the original poster (OP). The context provided by the previous and next utterances indicates a positive evaluation and appreciation of the OP's actions or character. The previous message describes the OP's response as genuine and empathetic, while the next message acknowledges the OP's efforts and mental state. 

Considering the communicative acts, the primary options are:
1. **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement. The phrase ""You're a good person"" can be seen as a form of praise.
2. **React**: This act shows engagement or listenership, often in a positive manner. However, ""You're a good person"" is more than just a reaction; it is evaluative.
3. **Claim**: While this act involves making a subjective assertion, the context of praise suggests a more specific intention than simply asserting.

The phrase ""You're a good person"" aligns most closely with **Congratulate**, as it praises the OP's character. This interpretation is supported by the surrounding context, which emphasizes empathy, effort, and being in the right headspace. The politeness dimension is positive politeness (+P), as it strengthens social bonds through praise.

Therefore, the best label for this utterance is **Congratulate** with a positive politeness marker. There are no clear meta-acts to apply.",86,93187
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance is an evaluation of the original poster's (OP's) state of mind and efforts, suggesting that they are capable of helping others due to their progress and current mindset. The preceding message praises OP as a ""good person,"" and the subsequent message mentions ""faith restored for a bit,"" indicating a positive sentiment towards OP's actions and character.

Considering possible communicative acts:
1. **Congratulate**: This would involve expressing praise for an achievement. The utterance does acknowledge the effort put in by OP, which could be construed as congratulatory.
2. **Claim**: This involves making a subjective assertion or opinion. The statement about OP being in the right headspace to help others is subjective and may not be verifiable.
3. **React**: This act involves showing engagement or listenership, which doesn't fully capture the evaluative nature of the statement.

The most fitting label is **Congratulate** because the utterance recognizes and praises OP for their self-improvement and readiness to assist others, which aligns with expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement. The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or meta-acts, such as sarcasm.

Thus, the final annotation should reflect the congratulatory nature of the utterance.",87,93187
React,,,"The target utterance ""faith restored for a bit"" is a reaction to the previous comment that praises the original poster for putting in the work and being in the right headspace to help others. This suggests that the speaker is expressing a momentary positive sentiment or feeling of hope, possibly due to the encouraging words they received. The phrase ""faith restored"" implies an emotional response, which aligns with the communicative act of ""React."" This act captures expressions of listenership and engagement, often emotional in nature, which seems to fit this context.

Additionally, the expression ""for a bit"" could indicate a temporary or tentative nature of this restored faith, but it doesn't change the primary function of the utterance as a reaction. There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm here. Therefore, the most fitting communicative act for this utterance is ""React.""",88,93188
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is asking the original poster about their actions upon being released from a detention facility. The primary function of this utterance is to seek information about the original poster's experience after gaining freedom. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Inquire,"" as it seeks specific information from the addressee.

Looking at the context:
- The previous message (""faith restored for a bit"") doesn't directly relate to the specific inquiry but indicates some hope or positive feeling, potentially related to the original poster's situation.
- The next message (""Did you see/speak to his family during all the courtroom stuff?"") is also an inquiry, seeking more information about the original poster's interactions during the legal proceedings.

Given that the primary function of the target utterance is to gather information, ""Inquire"" is the most fitting label. There's no clear indication of (im)politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm, so those aren't applicable here.",89,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is asking whether the original poster saw or spoke to the family of the person they killed during the courtroom events. This is a straightforward request for information, as the user is seeking a specific piece of factual information about the poster's experiences during the legal process.

The possible communicative acts for this utterance include:
1. **Inquire**: This act is used when someone is seeking information, typically through a question. The target utterance fits this description as it is phrased as a question seeking specific details.
2. **Request**: While similar to inquire, this act often involves seeking action or a favor, which is not the case here.

Given that the utterance is clearly a question seeking specific information, the most appropriate label is **Inquire**. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reported speech in this context. The question is direct and straightforward, focusing on gathering information.

Therefore, the best fitting act for this utterance is ""Inquire.""",90,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance, ""What’s your favourite colour?"", is an inquiry as it seeks information from the addressee. The previous utterance is a question about courtroom interactions, which is unrelated to the target question about color preferences. This indicates a shift in the topic of conversation. The next utterance, ""I apologized,"" does not provide further context for the inquiry about favorite color, suggesting that the target utterance stands alone as a question.

Considering potential communicative acts:
1. **Inquire**: The utterance directly seeks information, making it a straightforward example of an inquiry.
2. **Manage**: While managing the conversation could involve topic shifts, this utterance is more personal and specific, fitting better as an inquiry.

Given the structure and content of the utterance, ""Inquire"" is the most fitting label. There are no clear indications of politeness or non-bona fide elements in this simple question.

Thus, the best label is ""Inquire"" without any additional politeness or meta tags.",91,93188
Apologize,,,"In this utterance, the user is reflecting on a past action of apologizing. The phrase ""I apologized"" is a straightforward statement of having made an apology, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Apologize."" This act involves humbling oneself or making a self-deprecating remark in acknowledgment of a mistake or wrongdoing. The context provides no additional information to suggest another act, such as ""Inform,"" as the focus is not on providing factual information but on the act of apologizing itself. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts in this simple statement. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Apologize.""",92,93187
Reject,-P,,"The target utterance ""and they obviously didn’t care to hear it."" follows the user’s statement ""I apologized,"" indicating that the apology was not well-received. This suggests a sense of rejection or dismissal from the recipients of the apology. The word ""obviously"" implies that the user perceives the lack of interest as clear or evident. The word choice and tone indicate a negative response from the others involved, which aligns with the concept of rejection. 

Potential labels could include ""Reject"" or ""React"" (negative engagement). However, given the context where the user reflects on how their apology was not accepted or acknowledged, ""Reject"" seems the most appropriate label. The use of ""obviously"" also suggests a tone of resignation or understanding of the situation, but that doesn't change the fact that the apology was not accepted, which supports the ""Reject"" label.

There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in this utterance, as it is more a statement of fact from the user's perspective. Therefore, no politeness or meta-act tags are necessary.",93,93187
Accept,,,"To determine the communicative act for the target utterance ""But I understand,"" we need to consider its context within the conversation. The previous utterance, ""and they obviously didn’t care to hear it,"" suggests some form of rejection or dismissal by an unspecified group towards what the speaker had to say. The target utterance follows with ""But I understand,"" which implies that the speaker is expressing empathy or agreement with the implied sentiment or situation, even if others did not.

Two possible communicative acts that could fit here are:
1. **Accept**: This label is used when someone concurs or agrees with a previous statement. In this context, the speaker might be accepting the reality of the situation or the perspective of the others, even if it's not explicitly agreeable.
2. **Claim**: The speaker might be making a subjective assertion about their own understanding of the situation.

Given the context, ""But I understand"" seems to express a form of acknowledgment or acceptance of the situation described in the previous utterance. The use of ""But"" suggests a contrast to the previous sentiment of not being heard, implying a personal acceptance or understanding of why that might be the case. This aligns more closely with the **Accept** act, as the speaker is aligning themselves with the reality or perspective that others did not care to hear.

Thus, the most fitting label here is **Accept**. There is no clear politeness marker or meta-communication act evident in this utterance.",94,93187
Inform,,,"To determine the communicative act for the target utterance, we should consider the context provided by the surrounding messages. The previous message, ""But I understand,"" implies that the conversation may be about the speaker's experiences after being released from the juvenile facility. The target utterance, ""Ate food, slept in a regular bed, and hung out with my sister,"" lists activities that the speaker engaged in, likely after their release. This utterance provides concrete, verifiable information about actions taken, which aligns with the ""Inform"" act. The next message, ""What was the first thing you ate when you got out?"" suggests curiosity and further inquiry into the speaker's experiences post-release, reinforcing that the target utterance is indeed informative rather than speculative or subjective. Therefore, the most fitting label for the target utterance is ""Inform,"" as it gives factual information about the speaker's actions. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.",95,93187
Inquire,,,"In the context provided, the user (_chloebr) is engaging in a conversation where the previous message recounts some activities such as eating food, sleeping in a regular bed, and hanging out with their sister. The target utterance is a question directed at the original poster, who has shared about their past experiences related to being released from juvenile detention. The user asks, ""What was the first thing you ate when you got out?"" This is a clear attempt to seek specific information about the first food the original poster consumed after their release. The nature of the question is direct and straightforward, fitting the definition of an ""Inquire"" act, as it seeks information from the addressee. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm in this utterance; it is a genuine request for information.",96,93187
Inform,,,"In this context, the user is responding to a question about what they ate after being released. The response ""Pizza from my favorite pizza place"" provides a factual answer to the question. The key here is that the user is sharing a piece of verifiable information about their own experience, which aligns with the definition of the ""Inform"" communicative act. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or irony in the utterance, as it is a straightforward factual response to an inquiry.",97,93187
React,,,"In analyzing the target utterance ""lol"" within the context provided, it's essential to understand its purpose in the conversation. The previous message mentions ""Pizza from my favorite pizza place,"" which is a straightforward statement and possibly a light-hearted or casual remark. The user responds with ""lol,"" a common abbreviation for ""laugh out loud,"" which suggests a reaction to humor or amusement. The next message, ""Ooooh,"" indicates a continuation of the conversation in a similarly light-hearted or engaged manner.

The primary options for labeling ""lol"" include:

1. **React**: This label fits because ""lol"" is a typical way to show engagement or a positive, light-hearted reaction to the previous statement. It indicates that the user found the previous comment amusing or worthy of a casual, friendly acknowledgment.

2. **Accept**: While ""lol"" could imply agreement, it doesn't directly convey concurrence or agreement with the statement about pizza. Its primary function here is to express a reaction rather than acceptance.

Given the context, ""React"" is the most appropriate label. The use of ""lol"" suggests a positive, engaged reaction to the previous statement about pizza, consistent with the conversational tone and the subsequent ""Ooooh.""

There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm, as ""lol"" is straightforward here.

Therefore, the best fitting label is ""React"" without additional politeness or meta tags.",98,93188
React,,,"To determine the appropriate communicative act for the target utterance ""Ooooh,"" let's consider the context provided by the surrounding utterances.

1. **Possible Communicative Acts:**
   - **React**: The utterance ""Ooooh"" can be interpreted as a reaction, indicating excitement, surprise, or interest.
   - **Congratulate**: While ""Ooooh"" can sometimes express admiration, it does not directly convey praise or good wishes for an achievement.
   - **Accept**: Though it might signal agreement, the lack of explicit content makes it more of a general reaction.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The previous utterance is ""lol,"" which suggests a humorous or light-hearted tone in the conversation.
   - The next utterance is ""good choice! 🤤,"" which implies that the speaker is reacting positively to a decision or selection made by someone else.
   - ""Ooooh"" fits as a reaction to something mentioned previously, likely expressing interest or excitement about the choice that is being acknowledged positively in the next utterance.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The utterance ""Ooooh"" is best categorized as a **React** because it shows engagement or emotional response to the previous content, aligning with the positive tone of the conversation.

There are no clear indications of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm. Therefore, the annotation will focus solely on the communicative act.",99,93187
Congratulate,+P,,"The target utterance ""good choice! 🤤"" appears to be a positive evaluation of a previous choice mentioned by another user. The choice is likely related to something consumable, given the drooling emoji. The context is informal and supportive, suggesting that the speaker is agreeing with or approving the previous user's decision. 

Possible communicative acts include:
1. **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement or good decision. The use of ""good choice!"" aligns with this as it praises the decision.
2. **Accept**: This act involves agreeing or concurring with someone else's statement or choice. However, the enthusiasm and specific praise in the utterance lean more toward congratulating than merely accepting.

The next utterance, ""what toppings?"" implies a continuation of a conversation about food, likely pizza or something similar. This continuity supports the idea that the speaker is praising a choice related to food.

Given the context and the positive tone, ""Congratulate"" is the best-fitting label, as it captures the act of praising the decision made by the other user.

There is a positive politeness aspect due to the supportive and enthusiastic tone, conveyed by the emoji and the phrase ""good choice!"" which serves to build camaraderie and appreciation.",100,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""what toppings?"" is a question asking for specific information regarding the toppings on a pizza. The previous message, ""good choice! 🤤"", suggests that a type of pizza or food choice was just mentioned, and the user is now inquiring about the details of that choice. The next message, ""Bacon, sausage, pepperoni"", provides the specific information requested, confirming that the target utterance is indeed seeking information. The most fitting label for this communicative act is ""Inquire"" since it is a direct question asking for factual details. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts in the utterance.",101,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""Bacon, sausage, pepperoni"" is a response to a previous inquiry about what toppings the speaker prefers. The list provided is factual and directly answers the question, which suggests that the communicative act is ""Inform,"" as it provides verifiable information about the user's topping choices. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm, humor, or reported speech in this straightforward exchange. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform.""",102,93187
Inquire,,,"To determine the appropriate communicative act for the target utterance ""No pineapple!?"", we need to consider the context provided by the surrounding messages. The previous message is a list of pizza toppings: ""Bacon, sausage, pepperoni."" The target message is ""No pineapple!?"", followed by the next message, ""You’re missing out.""

1. **Possible Acts:**
   - **Inquire**: The target message could be interpreted as a question about the absence of pineapple as a topping.
   - **React**: It could also be a reaction expressing surprise or disappointment at the lack of pineapple.

2. **Contextual Consideration:**
   - The target message uses an exclamation mark and a question mark, suggesting both surprise and a question.
   - The context suggests that the user is responding to a list of toppings and questioning why pineapple is not included, which leans towards an inquiry about the omission.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The use of ""No pineapple!?"" is more aligned with an inquiry because it seeks to address the absence of an expected topping. The question mark indicates a request for information or clarification.
   - The next message, ""You’re missing out,"" suggests that the absence of pineapple is notable, supporting the interpretation of the target as an inquiry.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting communicative act is ""Inquire,"" as the user is seeking clarification on the absence of pineapple. There is no clear politeness or meta-act involved, so those remain empty.",103,93187
Claim,,,"In this context, the user ""Genetics"" is responding to a previous message that likely expressed surprise or disappointment about the absence of pineapple, possibly on a pizza, given the context of common online discussions about pineapple on pizza. The target utterance ""You’re missing out."" is a subjective assertion about the value or enjoyment of having pineapple. 

Two possible communicative acts could be considered here:
1. **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion that the absence of pineapple is depriving the previous speaker of a positive experience.
2. **React**: The user is showing engagement with the previous statement, possibly expressing a positive sentiment towards pineapple.

The more fitting act is **Claim** because the statement ""You’re missing out."" suggests an opinion or belief that having pineapple is a beneficial or enjoyable experience, which is subjective and unverifiable in principle.

There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance. The statement is straightforward and does not contain sarcasm, irony, or humor that would require additional annotation.",104,93187
Claim,,non-bona fide,"The target utterance ""I think people who like pineapples on pizza need to be incarcerated"" is a subjective statement, as it expresses a personal opinion about people who like pineapple on pizza. The word ""think"" indicates it's an opinion rather than a factual statement, aligning with the ""Claim"" communicative act. It doesn't seem to be meant literally but rather humorously or sarcastically, as indicated by the exaggerated notion of incarcerating people for their pizza preferences. This suggests a non-bona fide aspect to the claim.

Evaluating for politeness, the utterance doesn't insult or harm anyone directly, nor does it show positive or negative politeness. It's a playful exaggeration, likely meant to be humorous rather than offensive. However, the exaggeration in terms of seriousness (incarceration for a food preference) points to sarcasm or irony.

Thus, the most appropriate act is ""Claim"" with a ""non-bona fide"" meta tag for its exaggerated and humorous nature.",105,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""This is coming from an ex-con"" follows a statement expressing a humorous opinion about people who like pineapples on pizza. The prior message is clearly a joke, as it exaggerates the dislike for a particular pizza topping to the level of incarceration. The target utterance is likely a self-deprecating addition meant to add humor by juxtaposing the speaker's past as an ex-con with their opinion on such a trivial matter. This can be seen as an attempt to add humor or irony, acknowledging their own past incarceration and contrasting it with the humorous suggestion of incarcerating people over pizza toppings.

Considering the potential communicative acts, ""Claim"" could be a possibility since the speaker is making an assertion about themselves, but given the context of humor, it doesn't fully capture the intent. Another possibility is ""React"" as it shows engagement with the previous humorous statement, but it is not simply a reaction as it adds new information. The best fit is ""Claim"" because the user is asserting an identity (ex-con) in a humorous context, which is subjective and unverifiable in principle.

Additionally, the utterance is sarcastic or humorous given the context, which aligns with the use of [non‑bona fide]. The humor comes from the speaker's self-referential comment on their status as an ex-con juxtaposed with the triviality of the pizza topping debate. Therefore, the meta-act should be [non‑bona fide].

There is no clear politeness act here as it is meant to be humorous and self-deprecating rather than directly polite or impolite.

Thus, the appropriate annotation is:
- Act: Claim
- Politeness: (none)
- Meta: [non‑bona fide]",106,93188
React,,,"The target utterance is simply an emoji: 😂, which is a laughing face. This emoji typically conveys amusement or laughter, often used in response to something funny or absurd. 

1. **Possible Acts**:
   - **React**: The emoji is a classic representation of reacting to something, usually indicating an emotional response. In this context, it seems to be reacting to the previous comment, ""This is coming from an ex-con,"" which could be seen as amusing or ironic.
   - **Reject**: While it could be interpreted as mocking or dismissing the previous statement, the context does not provide a strong basis for interpreting it as a rejection.

2. **Narrowing Down**:
   - The context does not suggest any disagreement or confrontation that would warrant a ""Reject"" label. Instead, the emoji signifies a lighthearted or amused reaction, fitting well with ""React.""

3. **Testing Against Discourse**:
   - The previous message stated, ""This is coming from an ex-con,"" which could be seen as an unexpected or surprising revelation. The use of the 😂 emoji following this suggests the user found humor or irony in the statement, aligning with a reaction rather than rejection.

Given the context and typical usage of the laughing emoji, the most fitting label is ""React,"" as it captures the amusement or lighthearted engagement with the prior statement.

Politeness and meta-tags are not applicable here as the emoji does not convey any specific politeness strategy nor does it contain sarcasm, irony, or other non-bona fide communication.

Therefore, the final annotation is:",107,93187
Accept,,,"To determine the appropriate communicative act for the target utterance ""fair enough,"" let's consider the context provided by the surrounding messages. The previous message is a laughter emoji ""😂,"" which generally indicates a humorous or light-hearted context. The target utterance ""fair enough"" is often used to acknowledge or accept a point made by someone else, suggesting a willingness to agree or concede. The next message, ""Don’t knock it till you try it,"" seems to continue the conversation with a suggestion or advice, possibly related to the topic of humor or a joke.

The phrase ""fair enough"" in this context likely serves to accept or acknowledge the humor or point made in the previous message. It is a common expression used to show agreement or acceptance without strong commitment. Given this, the most appropriate label for this communicative act is ""Accept."" There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness beyond what is usual for the expression itself, and there are no meta-acts like sarcasm indicated here. Therefore, the annotation will focus on the acceptance aspect.

The analysis leads to the conclusion that the best-fitting label is ""Accept.""",108,93187
Direct,,,"The target utterance, ""Don’t knock it till you try it,"" is a commonly used phrase suggesting that one should not judge or criticize something without having experienced it first. This phrase is often used to advise or suggest that someone should be open-minded and try something before forming an opinion. 

Looking at the context, the previous utterance ""fair enough"" indicates some level of agreement or acceptance of a previous point, while the next utterance, ""i'm guessing these assholes who didn't care to hear it,"" suggests a critical or negative view of certain people who were not receptive.

In this context, the target phrase is likely being used to advise someone to try something before dismissing it. The phrase functions as an attempt to cause action, specifically to encourage a change in attitude or behavior, which aligns with the ""Direct"" communicative act.

There is no clear indication of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or irony in the phrase itself, as it is a straightforward, commonly-used expression. Therefore, no additional tags for politeness or meta-acts are warranted.

Thus, the best fitting label for this utterance is ""Direct.""",109,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""i'm guessing these assholes who didn't care to hear it,"" appears to express a subjective assertion about the attitudes of others. The phrase ""i'm guessing"" indicates that the speaker is making an assumption or a subjective inference about these ""assholes"" who presumably didn't care to listen to something important. This aligns with the act of making a Claim, as it involves a personal belief or interpretation that is not directly verifiable. 

Considering the context: 
- The previous message, ""Don’t knock it till you try it,"" suggests a discussion where someone is dismissing or criticizing something without fully understanding or experiencing it.
- The next message continues with the theme of neglect regarding the abuse that led to a death, reinforcing the idea that the target utterance is about people ignoring or being indifferent to a serious issue.

There are no explicit politeness or impoliteness markers in the target utterance, except for the use of ""assholes,"" which indicates a negative tone. However, this term is used to describe a group indirectly and not as a direct insult in a conversation. Therefore, it doesn't warrant a specific politeness or impoliteness label beyond the inherently negative connotation of the word itself. 

The primary act here is Claim, as the speaker is expressing an inferred opinion about the attitudes of others.",110,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance appears to build on the previous statement, which refers to ""assholes who didn't care to hear it."" The target utterance implies that these people also didn't care about the abuse that led to the boyfriend's death. This is a subjective assertion, as it reflects the speaker's opinion or belief about the attitudes of these people. The phrase ""didn't care"" suggests a lack of concern or empathy on the part of these individuals, but it doesn't provide verifiable information or seek to cause action. Instead, it makes a subjective claim about their indifference. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Claim.""

The politeness dimension isn't directly addressed here since the utterance doesn't display any positive or negative politeness strategies. It's more of an expression of opinion. As such, there's no need for a politeness or meta label. Thus, the appropriate label is ""Claim"" with no additional politeness or meta tags.",111,93189
Claim,-P,,"In analyzing the target utterance, ""i'm sure they fought to have you given more time like, life in prison,"" we must consider the tone and intention behind it. The previous message discusses the lack of care for the abuse that led to the abusive boyfriend's death. The target utterance seems to imply that someone (likely the authorities or the legal system) wanted the original poster to receive a harsher punishment. This could be seen as a claim, as it expresses the speaker's belief or assumption about others' actions, which is subjective and not necessarily verifiable. However, the tone also suggests a layer of sarcasm, indicating disbelief or criticism of the justice system's potential harshness.

This sarcastic tone aligns with the [non-bona fide] meta-act, as it implies the speaker does not genuinely believe or support what they're saying but is instead using irony to critique or express disbelief. The sarcasm also aligns with the impoliteness act –P [Sarcasm], as it subtly mocks the idea that the justice system would push for harsher punishment, possibly indicating the speaker's view that such a punishment would be unjust or excessive.

Thus, the most fitting annotation would be a Claim, as it represents a subjective assertion, with an added layer of sarcasm indicated by the [non-bona fide] meta-act. The impoliteness component is also present, given the sarcastic nature of the utterance. However, since we're focusing on communicative acts, the primary act remains a Claim with sarcasm noted in the meta section.

Therefore, the annotation should be:
Claim with sarcasm as [non-bona fide] for the meta-act.",112,93188
Manage,,,"The target utterance ""but i digress"" is a transitional phrase commonly used to acknowledge a deviation from the main topic of discussion. It serves to redirect attention back to the primary focus, indicating a shift in the conversation.

In this context, the previous message implies a strong opinion about the legal consequences the original poster might have faced, suggesting that others may have wanted harsher penalties. The target utterance, ""but i digress,"" suggests that the speaker is aware they are venturing into a tangent or less relevant point and is pulling back to refocus on the main topic.

The communicative act here is not about providing new information, nor is it an inquiry, a directive, or a reaction. Instead, it is a form of managing the conversation. The speaker is essentially signaling a pause or a shift in the direction of the discourse, which aligns with the ""Manage"" communicative act. This act involves organizing or focusing the discussion, which fits the function of ""but i digress"" as it serves to manage the flow of conversation.

Therefore, the best label for the target utterance is ""Manage,"" as it directs the conversation back to its intended course. There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts in this short phrase, so no additional tags are necessary.",113,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance expresses a subjective observation about the families of abusers. The speaker is making a general statement based on their own experience, which fits the definition of a ""Claim,"" as it is a subjective assertion and unverifiable in principle. The use of ""Unfortunately"" adds an emotional tone but does not change the nature of the act as a claim. The prior message ""but I digress"" suggests a shift in focus or topic, but it does not provide additional context that would alter the classification of the target utterance. The next message, ""It sucks..."" seems to agree or sympathize with the target utterance, reinforcing that the target is indeed expressing a personal viewpoint rather than an objective fact. There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting in this utterance. Thus, the most appropriate label for the target utterance is ""Claim.""",114,93187
React,,,"The target utterance ""It sucks..."" is a short expression of frustration or dissatisfaction. Let's evaluate potential communicative acts:

1. **React**: This act involves showing engagement or emotional response to the previous statement. The phrase ""It sucks..."" often indicates an emotional reaction to a situation, typically one of disappointment or frustration. Given the context, where the previous utterance discusses the unwillingness of abusers' families to acknowledge the abuse, the user's response aligns with expressing a negative emotion toward that reality.

2. **Claim**: While it could be seen as a subjective assertion of how the situation feels, the phrase ""It sucks..."" primarily conveys an emotional reaction rather than an assertion.

3. **Reject**: This act would typically involve disagreement or challenge, which doesn't fit here as the user is not opposing the previous statement but rather responding emotionally to it.

Considering the context and the nature of the utterance, ""React"" is the most fitting act because the user is engaging with the previous statement by expressing a feeling of frustration.

There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts in this short phrase.",115,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance states that people will believe anything to maintain a certain mindset about their abusive family member. The speaker is making a subjective assertion about people's behavior and beliefs. Let's evaluate potential labels:

1. **Claim**: This label fits because the user is expressing a subjective opinion about people's tendency to maintain a particular belief about family members. Such assertions are generally unverifiable, as they reflect personal judgment about others' thought processes.

2. **Reject**: This label might fit if the speaker were directly disputing a previous statement. However, the speaker is not directly contradicting a specific claim made by another user.

3. **Inform**: This label would apply if the speaker were providing factual information. However, the statement is more of an opinion than a factual report.

Given these considerations, ""Claim"" is the most fitting label as the user is expressing a viewpoint that is subjective and reflects their personal perspective on human behavior. There are no clear politeness or meta elements in the utterance.",116,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""And this entire paragraph is proof for second chances with youth."" can be interpreted in a few ways. Let's evaluate potential communicative acts:

1. **Claim**: The user is expressing a subjective opinion about the paragraph, suggesting it supports the idea of giving youth second chances. This is unverifiable as it reflects personal interpretation.

2. **Inform**: If the user was stating a verifiable fact, it would be labeled as Inform. However, the nature of the statement is more opinion-based than factual.

3. **React**: The user might be reacting to the previous message, which discusses the perception of abusive family members. This interpretation is less direct since the focus is on making a point rather than showing engagement.

Given the context, the most fitting label is **Claim**. The user is asserting a personal viewpoint about second chances for youth based on the paragraph's content, which aligns with expressing a subjective opinion.

There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting. Therefore, no additional tags are necessary.",117,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""You murdered him, you had an excellent reason to do so,"" is providing an opinion about the original poster's actions. The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the justification for the murder, implying that the reason was ""excellent"" despite the severity of the act. This fits the criteria for a ""Claim"" as it expresses a subjective viewpoint that is unverifiable in principle.

Considering other possible acts:
- ""Inform"" would not fit because the statement is not presenting verifiable facts.
- ""React"" could be considered, but the statement is more evaluative and assertive than a simple reaction.

The context includes a prior statement that discusses second chances and a subsequent statement about empathy, suggesting the speaker is assessing the situation from a moral standpoint. This reinforces that the statement is a subjective claim about the justification of the action.

There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed, and no meta-acts like sarcasm or reported speech are involved.

Thus, ""Claim"" is the most appropriate label for this utterance.",118,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""and you still have empathy for those who loved him"" follows a statement acknowledging the reason for the murder (""You murdered him, you had an excellent reason to do so"") and precedes a statement expressing a belief in the user's potential as a trial judge. The utterance itself is acknowledging the user's capacity for empathy despite the violent act they committed. 

There are a few possible communicative acts to consider:
1. **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the user's empathy, which is based on the user's past actions and the current discussion. This is unverifiable in principle because it's about the user's internal state.
2. **Congratulate**: The speaker is expressing a form of praise for the user's empathy. However, this doesn't quite fit as there isn't a specific achievement being praised.
3. **React**: The speaker could be reacting to the previous statement about the murder and the reason for it, by highlighting the user's empathy. However, this doesn't fit well as it lacks the emotional engagement typical of a reaction.

The most fitting label is **Claim** because the speaker is making an assertion about the user's character trait (empathy) without any verifiable evidence, reflecting their subjective perspective. There is no clear politeness or meta-act present in the utterance. 

Thus, the best annotation is:
- **Act**: Claim
- **Politeness**: None
- **Meta**: None",119,93187
Claim,+P,,"The target utterance ""I believe that you would make an excellent trial judge"" is a statement directed at the original poster, ""JuvieThrowaw."" This statement expresses a positive opinion about the poster's ability to empathize and understand complex situations, as suggested by the previous message about having empathy for those who loved the abusive boyfriend.

Let's consider possible communicative acts:
1. **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement. The statement does not congratulate ""JuvieThrowaw"" on an achievement but rather expresses a positive opinion about their character or potential role as a trial judge.
2. **Claim**: This involves making a subjective assertion or opinion. The use of ""I believe"" indicates that the statement is the speaker's personal opinion or belief, which aligns with the definition of a claim.
3. **Compliment** (+P): While the statement is positive and complimentary, the primary communicative act focuses on expressing a belief or opinion, which leans more towards a claim than a congratulatory act.

The utterance is subjective and unverifiable, making **Claim** the most appropriate label. Additionally, the statement is positively framed, indicating positive politeness through a compliment.

Therefore, the best fit is ""Claim"" with positive politeness. There is no specific meta-act to apply here.",120,93189
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""Do you feel any pride for taking him out?"" is a direct question aimed at the original poster (OP) who shared their story about shooting their mother's abusive boyfriend. The user is seeking to understand OP's emotional response to the action they took. This is an inquiry into the OP's feelings, specifically regarding pride.

Considering the possible communicative acts:
1. **Inquire**: This is the most straightforward interpretation. The user is asking for information about OP's feelings, which fits the definition of seeking information.
2. **Request**: This could be considered if the question was phrased more as a polite request for OP to share their feelings. However, the phrasing here is more of a straightforward question than a request.

Given the context, the question is clearly seeking information, not making a request or stating a fact. Therefore, the most fitting label is ""Inquire.""

Politeness or meta-acts: There's no clear indication of politeness strategies or non-bona fide communication (such as sarcasm) in this question. The user seems to be genuinely asking for OP's feelings on the matter.

Thus, the annotation should be:
- Act: Inquire
- Politeness: None
- Meta: None",121,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Not in a 'I love to murder' way but in a 'I'm glad I did what needed to be done' way."" is a response to the question about feeling pride for taking someone out, presumably the mother's abusive boyfriend. The user is clarifying their feelings by contrasting two different perspectives: one that could be interpreted as loving to murder and another where they felt the action was necessary. The phrase ""I'm glad I did what needed to be done"" suggests a subjective perspective on the necessity and righteousness of the action taken. This matches the definition of a Claim, which involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle. Although the user is not stating they are proud, they are expressing a form of satisfaction or relief about their action, which doesn't quite fit as a Desire since it's not about a future want or hope but rather a reflection on past actions. There are no indications of politeness or impoliteness in the statement, and it is not a reported or non-bona fide utterance. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is Claim.",122,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance is ""I’m not proud,"" which follows the previous sentence where the user clarifies their feelings about the act of murder, distinguishing it from enjoyment. The next sentence continues with ""but I do believe that I did the right thing,"" which suggests a nuanced reflection on their past actions.

Given this context, let's consider possible communicative acts:

1. **Apologize**: This act involves self-deprecation or acknowledging a fault. The phrase ""I’m not proud"" could indicate an acknowledgment of discomfort with the past action, but it doesn't explicitly express fault or regret.

2. **Claim**: This involves making a subjective assertion. Saying ""I’m not proud"" is a subjective statement about the speaker’s feelings, which is unverifiable and subjective.

3. **Elaborate**: This act involves explaining or paraphrasing a previous statement. While ""I’m not proud"" adds to the previous statement, it doesn't directly paraphrase or expand on it in a detailed way.

The most fitting act is **Claim** because ""I’m not proud"" is a clear expression of the user's internal, subjective state rather than an apology or an elaboration. The user is sharing a personal feeling about their past actions, which matches the definition of a claim.

There are no clear indicators of politeness or impoliteness. The utterance is straightforward and does not contain any sarcasm or reported speech.

Thus, the appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim"" without any additional politeness or meta tags.",123,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""but I do believe that I did the right thing"" follows a statement of not being proud (""I’m not proud"") and is followed by a statement of happiness about the outcome (""and am happy that I got my mom and sister out of the position""). The word ""believe"" indicates a subjective assertion about the action taken by the user. This reflects the user's personal conviction rather than an objective truth or external validation. Therefore, the most fitting communicative act here is ""Claim,"" as it expresses the user's personal belief about the morality of their actions. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness, nor any meta-acts like reported speech or sarcasm, in this utterance.",124,93187
Claim,,,"In the target utterance, the user reflects on the outcome of a past action and expresses satisfaction with having helped his family. The phrase ""am happy that I got my mom and sister out of the position"" is a subjective expression of his feelings about the situation. The key element here is the user's personal satisfaction and emotional response to the action he took, which aligns with making a subjective assertion about his feelings. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Claim,"" as the user is asserting a personal belief or feeling that is subjective and not verifiable by others.

The context supports this interpretation: the previous utterance also reflects on the user's belief about his past actions, and the following utterance inquires about his sister's well-being, suggesting that the focus is on personal experiences and feelings. There is no explicit politeness or meta-act expressed in this utterance, as it is straightforward and not sarcastic or reported speech.",125,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance ""how's your sister doing?"" is a question directed at the person who has shared a personal story about their past experiences. The question seeks to obtain information about the current status or well-being of the sister, which is a follow-up to the previous message that mentioned getting the mother and sister out of a difficult situation.

Considering the communicative acts:
1. **Inquire**: The utterance is a straightforward question asking for information about the sister's current condition or status. This fits well with the definition of an inquiry, as it seeks information from the addressee.
2. **React**: While the question does show engagement with the previous story, its primary function is to seek information rather than simply acknowledge or react to the previous message.

Given that the primary purpose of the utterance is to seek information, the most appropriate label is **Inquire**. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness, and no meta-acts like sarcasm or reported speech are present. Therefore, no additional tags are necessary.",126,93189
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is a question: ""are close are you to her?"" which seems to be a typo and likely intended to be ""how close are you to her?"" This indicates that the speaker is seeking information about the relationship between the person they're talking to and the sister mentioned in the previous utterance. In the context of the conversation, where someone asks about the well-being of the sister, it makes sense to follow up with a question about the relationship's closeness. Therefore, the act is most likely an ""Inquire,"" as the speaker is asking for information. The next message confirms the inquiry by providing an answer, ""We are very close."" There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting, so those tags are not needed here.",127,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""We are very close."" is a response to a previous inquiry about the closeness of the speaker to someone, presumably a family member or a close friend. The statement is providing factual information about the relationship between the speaker and the person in question. The phrase ""We are very close"" is a straightforward assertion of the nature of their relationship. It is a verifiable statement, as it describes a specific state of affairs regarding their relationship. 

The next utterance ""She’s doing great"" continues the thread by providing additional factual information about the person mentioned. 

Considering the context, the most fitting communicative act for the target utterance is ""Inform,"" as it provides verifiable information about the closeness of the relationship. There are no clear signs of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any indication of sarcasm or irony. Therefore, the politeness and meta fields remain empty.",128,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance is ""She’s doing great,"" which is a statement about the current status of someone, presumably the user's sister given the context of the previous and next utterances. The previous sentence, ""We are very close,"" suggests a personal relationship, likely referring to a family member or close friend. The next sentence, ""and is close to graduating college,"" provides additional context about the same person being discussed, indicating progress or success in an academic setting.

There are a few possible communicative acts for this utterance:

1. **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about someone's current well-being, which is verifiable to the interlocutors.
2. **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about someone's status. However, since this is more of a factual update on someone's condition, it leans more towards an Inform act than a Claim.
3. **Congratulate**: It does not fit this act because the speaker is not directly expressing praise or good wishes; rather, they are simply stating a fact.

The most fitting label here is **Inform** because the speaker is providing a factual update about someone’s well-being, which is a verifiable piece of information within the context of the conversation. There is no clear expression of politeness or meta-acts associated with this utterance. Therefore, the annotation will focus solely on the act.

Considering all of this, the best label for the utterance is ""Inform.""",129,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance, ""and is close to graduating college,"" is a continuation of the previous message, ""She’s doing great."" The speaker is providing additional information about ""she,"" likely referring to a person mentioned earlier in the conversation. The act of providing additional details about someone's status or achievements is categorized as ""Inform"" because it offers verifiable factual information, even though the specific details (like the person's identity) are not disclosed in this snippet. The previous message hints at a positive context, but the target utterance itself does not include any explicit politeness or meta-acts. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform,"" with no additional politeness or meta-annotations needed.",130,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance, ""How are you doing?"" is a common inquiry used to ask about someone's current state or well-being. In this context, it follows a statement about someone being close to graduating college, which might be a positive or stressful time for them. The next utterance, ""I’m doing better,"" directly answers the question posed in the target utterance, indicating that ""How are you doing?"" is indeed an inquiry seeking information about the other person's current state. Therefore, the most suitable label for this utterance is ""Inquire,"" as it seeks information. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm, so those tags will remain empty.",131,93187
Inform,,,"In this context, the user ""JuvieThrowaw"" is responding to an inquiry about their well-being. The target utterance ""I’m doing better"" is providing information about their current state, suggesting improvement from a previous state. The communicative act that best fits this utterance is ""Inform,"" as the user is giving factual information about their current condition.

Looking at the potential for politeness or impoliteness:
- The utterance doesn't contain any explicit markers of politeness or impoliteness.
- It's a straightforward response to a question about well-being, which is typical in casual conversation.

Therefore, no additional politeness or meta-act annotations are necessary. The primary act here is ""Inform.""",132,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""I’m currently in school for social work."" provides factual information about the speaker's current educational pursuit. The statement is straightforward and verifiable, making it a clear example of the ""Inform"" communicative act. The context provided by the previous and next utterances supports this interpretation, as the speaker is sharing updates about their life and future aspirations. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or irony, so those are not applicable here.",133,93187
Desire,,,"The target utterance by ""JuvieThrowaw"" is ""I want to help kids in abusive situations learn to cope and navigate with it all in a healthy manner, unlike my situation."" In examining possible communicative acts, ""Desire"" and ""Claim"" are both contenders.

1. **Desire**: The user expresses a wish or hope to help kids in abusive situations. The use of ""I want to"" indicates a clear desire or aspiration, which aligns with expressing a wish or hope for the future.

2. **Claim**: While the statement could be seen as an assertion about his intentions, the focus on ""I want to"" leans more towards expressing a future-oriented hope rather than making a factual assertion or belief.

Given the context, the user's statement is more about expressing a personal aspiration rather than asserting a fact or subjective opinion. Therefore, the ""Desire"" act is the most fitting label for this utterance. There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness, and no meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting are present.

Thus, the best label for this utterance is ""Desire.""",134,93188
React,,,"The target utterance ""legend"" is an evaluation of the previous message, where the user expresses a desire to help kids in abusive situations. The utterance ""legend"" is likely meant to convey admiration or approval, suggesting that the speaker considers the previous user's intentions as admirable or heroic.

In terms of communicative acts, ""legend"" is not providing new information, nor is it making an inquiry. It is a reaction, specifically showing a positive engagement with the previous message. The use of the word ""legend"" typically implies praise or admiration in informal contexts, making it a positive reaction to the user's desire to help others.

There is no direct politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance, nor is there any non-bona fide aspect like sarcasm. The utterance is straightforward in its admiration.

The most fitting communicative act label for this utterance is ""React"" because it shows positive engagement with the previous user's statement. There are no politeness or meta tags applicable here.

Therefore, the annotation should be:",135,93187
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance ""Absolute legend"" is a strong expression of praise and admiration for someone, likely the original poster of the thread. In the context of online discussions, calling someone a ""legend"" is a way to commend them for their actions or story. The prior message is simply ""legend,"" which also indicates a similar sentiment of admiration. The subsequent message ""Bravo!"" further supports this interpretation as it also expresses praise. Given these considerations, the most fitting communicative act for ""Absolute legend"" is ""Congratulate,"" as it conveys commendation and admiration for an achievement or action. There are no clear indications of politeness or meta-acts beyond the expression of praise itself.",136,93187
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance ""Bravo!"" is a one-word exclamation that expresses approval or admiration. In the context of the preceding message ""Absolute legend,"" it is evident that the user is expressing praise or recognition of the original poster's actions or story. The subsequent message reinforces this with more explicit praise and encouragement. The most appropriate communicative act for ""Bravo!"" is ""Congratulate"" as it aligns with expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement or action. There is no clear politeness or meta-act to annotate here.",137,93187
Congratulate,+P,,"In analyzing the target utterance, ""I bet you will make a beautiful difference in a few lives with your work, and your unfortunate experience,"" we need to consider the communicative act that FleeshaLoo is performing. 

1. **Possible Acts:**
   - **Desire**: This act involves expressing a hope, wish, or speculation. The phrase ""I bet"" implies a level of speculation or hope regarding the future impact of the person's work and experiences.
   - **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes for achievement. While the target doesn't directly congratulate the user for an achievement, it does express a positive prediction about their future impact, which can be seen as a form of praise or good wishes.

2. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The previous utterance, ""Bravo!"" suggests a tone of praise and admiration, which aligns with the congratulatory nature of the target utterance.
   - The next utterance, ""I don't have an actual question,"" indicates that the current utterance is not seeking information or requesting anything, further supporting that it is a statement of belief or encouragement.

3. **Final Decision:**
   - Given the context and the construction of the target utterance, it leans more towards expressing good wishes and admiration for the potential positive impact the person will have. Therefore, ""Congratulate"" is the most fitting label.
   - Additionally, there is a positive politeness aspect here, as FleeshaLoo is showing solidarity and support to the original poster by acknowledging their potential to impact others positively.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Congratulate"" with a positive politeness marker.",138,93187
Inform,,,"In the given context, the target utterance ""I don't have an actual question"" follows a message that expresses encouragement and hope for positive outcomes from the user's past experiences. The target utterance seems to acknowledge the context of an ""Ask Me Anything"" (AMA) format, where asking questions is expected. However, the user explicitly states that they do not have a question.

Considering possible communicative acts:

1. **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about their current state—they don't have a question. This could be considered an instance of informing because it relates directly to the expected format of the conversation.

2. **React**: The statement could also be a reaction to the ongoing conversation, acknowledging the format of an AMA without contributing a question.

3. **Reject**: The user might be implicitly rejecting the expectation to ask a question, but the tone is not confrontational or dismissive.

Given that the statement is straightforwardly providing information about the user's intention (or lack thereof) to ask a question, and considering the context of an AMA, **Inform** seems to be the most appropriate act. The utterance doesn't carry any politeness or meta-communication features that need to be tagged.

Thus, the best-fitting label for this utterance is **Inform**.",139,93187
Desire,,,"The target utterance expresses a sentiment regarding the original poster's experience. The user, FleeshaLoo, is not asking a question or providing factual information. Instead, they are expressing a hope, which aligns with the act of ""Desire."" This act is used to express wants, hopes, or speculations.

The phrase ""I do hope you did not suffer too much while in juvie"" is clearly expressing a hope or wish regarding the past experience of the original poster. It does not provide new information or seek to elicit action, which rules out acts like ""Inform"" or ""Request."" The context does not indicate any sarcasm or irony, so the utterance is genuine in its expression of concern or empathy.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate communicative act label for this utterance is ""Desire."" There is no explicit politeness strategy or meta-act like sarcasm, so those categories remain untagged.",140,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""A close friend of mine is a Social Worker"" is a standalone statement that provides information about the user's social circle. Let's evaluate possible communicative acts for this utterance:

1. **Inform**: The user is providing factual information about their friend, which can be verified. This is the most straightforward interpretation because the statement is simply about the profession of their friend.

2. **Claim**: While the statement is subjective in terms of its relevance to the discussion, it isn't unverifiable. The user's friend being a social worker can be confirmed, making ""Inform"" more appropriate.

3. **React**: The statement could be seen as a way to engage with the previous comment about suffering in juvenile detention, possibly suggesting empathy or understanding through association with a social worker. However, it doesn't directly express an emotional reaction or engagement.

The most fitting label here is ""Inform"" because the user is providing a piece of factual information about their friend. There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or humor.

Based on the reasoning above, the best fit is:
- **Act**: Inform
- **Politeness**: None
- **Meta**: None",141,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""and she loves her job."" is providing information about the friend's feelings towards her job as a Social Worker. The previous context mentions that the speaker has a close friend who is a Social Worker, and the target sentence elaborates on this by stating her affection for her occupation. This is a subjective assertion because it reflects the friend's personal feelings, which cannot be objectively verified. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim.""

There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance, nor is there any meta-communication (such as sarcasm or reporting) indicated. The statement is straightforward and does not require any additional annotation for politeness or meta-acts.",142,93188
Inform,,,"The target utterance involves the speaker describing an action they take, which is collecting household items and clothing for someone (presumably ""her"" from the previous context). This act is something the speaker does regularly, as indicated by the phrase ""to add to my own bags of stuff."" The context suggests that this action is part of a routine or habitual behavior.

There are a few possible communicative acts to consider:

1. **Inform**: The speaker provides verifiable information about what they do. This fits because the speaker is detailing an action they regularly perform.
   
2. **Claim**: This could be a subjective assertion about their behavior. However, since the statement involves a specific, factual action rather than an unverifiable opinion, ""Claim"" is less fitting.

3. **Desire**: The speaker might express a desire to help. However, the focus is more on reporting a regular action rather than expressing hope or speculation.

Given the context, ""Inform"" is the most suitable label because the speaker is conveying factual information about their activities, which can be verified by their behavior. There is no clear expression of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.",143,93187
Inform,,,"In analyzing the target utterance, ""I no longer want/need, for her,"" we need to determine the primary communicative act. 

1. **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about personal wants and needs. This could fit, as it describes the speaker's personal preferences regarding the items.

2. **Inform**: The speaker could be providing factual information about their actions regarding the items they no longer want or need. It is meant to explain why they are collecting these items for someone else.

The context from the previous and next utterances supports that the speaker is explaining their actions in a factual manner, providing reasons for collecting items for someone. The focus is on the action of collecting items rather than the subjective aspect of want or need. 

Therefore, the most appropriate label is **Inform** because the speaker is providing information about the items they are collecting and why they are doing so. There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.",144,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance provides information about the lack of funding for clients who are out on their own for the first time. It explains that even buying items at thrift stores can be out of budget due to this financial constraint. This is not a subjective assertion or a personal opinion, as it is framed as a factual statement about a situation faced by clients. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform"" because it conveys verifiable information about financial challenges. There is no indication of politeness or a meta-act being used in this context, so those tags will not be added.",145,93187
Claim,,,"In analyzing the target utterance, ""You quite possibly saved your mom's life, if not also your own life and that of your sister,"" we need to determine its primary communicative act.

1. **Claim**: This utterance makes a subjective assertion about the impact of the original poster's actions. It speculates on the potential lives saved, which is unverifiable in principle. Thus, it fits the criteria for a claim, as it expresses an opinion or belief about the situation.

2. **Congratulate**: While the utterance acknowledges a positive outcome (saving lives), it lacks explicit praise or good wishes typically associated with congratulations. Instead, it focuses more on the hypothetical impact rather than celebrating an achievement.

3. **Desire**: This act involves expressing wishes or hopes, which doesn't align with the structure of the utterance, as it doesn't express a wish for future outcomes but rather comments on past actions.

The strongest fit is **Claim** because the user is asserting a belief about the positive impact of the user's past actions, without explicit praise or a desire for future actions. There is no clear use of politeness or meta-acts in the statement. 

Thus, the label for this utterance is ""Claim"".",146,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""It's tragic that abusers so often get away with it"" is expressing a subjective opinion about a broader societal issue. The user's statement is not providing factual information, nor is it an inquiry or request for action. Instead, it reflects a personal viewpoint on the frequency with which abusers escape consequences for their actions. This aligns with the definition of a ""Claim,"" as it is an unverifiable assertion about abusers generally. There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there sarcasm or irony, so additional tags are unnecessary. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",147,93189
Claim,,,"In this context, the user is responding to the tragic nature of abusers getting away with their actions. The target utterance suggests that the original poster's action, while extreme, may have prevented future harm. This implies a belief or subjective view, focusing on the potential positive outcome of the original poster's action. The act of expressing this view aligns most closely with a ""Claim,"" as it presents an unverifiable assertion about the impact of the actions taken. It is not a direct agreement or disagreement, nor is it providing factual information, hence ""Claim"" fits best. There is no clear politeness or meta-act present, as the statement is straightforward without sarcasm or humor.",148,93187
React,+P,,"The target utterance ""Hugs"" is a brief and informal expression often used to convey support, comfort, or solidarity. In the context of the previous message, where the user acknowledges the positive impact that the original poster's actions might have had (saving others from potential harm), the use of ""Hugs"" appears to be an extension of this supportive sentiment.

Considering the possible communicative acts:
1. **Greet**: ""Hugs"" can be used as a form of greeting or leave-taking in some contexts, but in this case, it doesn't fit the pattern of a typical greeting or farewell.
2. **Congratulate**: While ""Hugs"" can convey warmth, it doesn't specifically praise or offer good wishes for an achievement, so it doesn't fit here.
3. **React**: This act involves showing engagement or listenership, which aligns with the supportive and empathetic tone of ""Hugs.""

Given the context and the typical usage of ""Hugs"" in CMC, it is most appropriately labeled as a **React** act. The utterance shows positive engagement with the previous message, aligning with the supportive sentiment expressed.

The politeness dimension here is positive politeness, as ""Hugs"" is a supportive gesture that builds solidarity and shows empathy.

The act is straightforward and does not fall under any meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting.

Thus, the best label for this utterance is ""React"" with a politeness annotation of ""+P"" for positive politeness. There are no meta-acts applicable.",149,93187
Greet,+P,,"To determine the appropriate communicative act for the target utterance ""and best wishes to you."", we need to consider the context provided by the surrounding messages. The previous message ""Hugs"" suggests a warm, supportive tone, likely indicating an expression of positive sentiment or solidarity. The target message continues this tone by offering ""best wishes,"" which is a form of well-wishing or expressing goodwill towards someone. The next message is ""Thank you!"", indicating that the recipient interpreted the message positively and appreciated it.

The most fitting communicative act for ""and best wishes to you."" is **Greet**, as it involves well-wishing. This act includes expressions of goodwill or positive sentiment, which aligns with the intention behind ""best wishes.""

In terms of politeness, the target message is a clear example of positive politeness, as it offers support and goodwill, strengthening social bonds.

There are no meta-acts applicable here, as the message is straightforward and genuine.

Therefore, the annotation for the target utterance should be:
- Act: Greet
- Politeness: +P (Positive Politeness)
- Meta: None",150,93187
Thank,+P,,"The target utterance ""Thank you!"" is a response to a previous message that likely expressed well wishes or support, as indicated by the phrase ""and best wishes to you."" The phrase ""Thank you!"" is a direct expression of gratitude, which aligns with the communicative act of **Thank**. 

Considering the context, this utterance is a straightforward expression of appreciation, without any additional layers of meaning or sarcasm. There is no indication of impoliteness, and it is a positive interaction where gratitude is expressed, which can be seen as a form of positive politeness.

The next message, ""I believe we should be thanking you,"" suggests that the expression of thanks is being reciprocated or acknowledged, but it doesn't change the nature of the target utterance itself.

Thus, the most fitting label for this utterance is **Thank**, with an additional **+P** politeness tag indicating positive politeness. There are no meta-act considerations such as sarcasm or reporting.",151,93187
Thank,+P,,"The target utterance ""I believe we should be thanking you."" is a response to the previous utterance ""Thank you!"" This indicates a reciprocal exchange of gratitude. The phrase ""I believe"" introduces a subjective assertion, suggesting that it's an opinion or claim. However, the main function of the utterance is to express gratitude, implying it is an act of thanking. The use of ""we should be thanking you"" implies a collective appreciation, enhancing the politeness aspect by acknowledging the contribution of the addressee. This is a positive politeness strategy, as it builds solidarity and acknowledges the other person's worth. 

Considering these aspects, the most appropriate communicative act is ""Thank."" The politeness marker ""+P"" applies due to the positive and appreciative tone of the utterance. There is no indication of meta-acts like sarcasm or reported speech, so the ""meta"" field remains empty.",152,93187
Thank,+P,,"The target utterance is a continuation of an expression of gratitude from the previous message. The user is acknowledging the actions of the original poster (""Putting yourself out there for younger people..."") and highlighting their positive impact. This utterance serves to reinforce the sentiment of appreciation that was started in the previous message, where the user states, ""I believe we should be thanking you."" 

In terms of communicative acts, this utterance is not providing new factual information but rather emphasizing the value of the original poster's actions, aligning with the expression of gratitude. Thus, the most fitting label here is **Thank** because it completes the act of expressing gratitude initiated in the previous utterance.

Regarding politeness, the utterance is positively polite as it shows appreciation and solidarity with the original poster's efforts. Therefore, it aligns with positive politeness (+P). There are no non-bona fide elements such as sarcasm, irony, or other meta-acts present.

In conclusion, the target utterance is best labeled as **Thank** with a positive politeness marker.",153,93187
Thank,+P,,"The target utterance is an expression of gratitude. The previous message suggests an appreciation for someone putting themselves out there to help younger people, which implies that the thank you is directed at this person or action. The target utterance, ""THANK YOU!!!!"", is an enthusiastic expression of gratitude, fitting the ""Thank"" communicative act. There is no additional context suggesting sarcasm or irony, so there is no need for a non-bona fide tag. The use of all caps and multiple exclamation marks indicates a strong expression of positive politeness, aligning with positive politeness. Therefore, the label for the politeness is ""+P"".",154,93187
React,+P,,"The target utterance ""Great man"" is a brief expression of positive evaluation or approval. It appears after an expression of gratitude (""THANK YOU!!!!""), suggesting that the user ""scarface128"" is responding positively to something the original poster (OP) has shared or done. The next utterance starts with ""From what i've read in your OP and comments,"" indicating that the discussion is about the OP's previous contributions.

Given this context, ""Great man"" seems to be praising or acknowledging the OP's actions or character in a positive light. The most fitting communicative act here is ""React,"" as it is showing engagement and a positive response to what has been shared. There's no direct invitation or requirement for further action or discussion, which rules out acts like ""Congratulate"" or ""Invite."" Additionally, the phrase does not provide new information or make a subjective claim, which rules out ""Inform"" or ""Claim.""

There is a positive politeness aspect (+P) in the form of a compliment, as ""Great man"" conveys respect and admiration.

Thus, the best label for this utterance is ""React"" with positive politeness.",155,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""From what i've read in your OP and comments...."" appears to be setting the stage for a more detailed comment, likely leading to a statement of opinion or judgment about the situation described in the original post (OP). This utterance serves as a preface, indicating that the speaker has gathered information from the OP and comments, and it is likely leading to an evaluative statement or personal reflection.

Possible communicative acts for this utterance could include:
1. **Claim**: If the statement following this preface was a subjective assertion or opinion.
2. **Elaborate**: If the speaker is going to provide more details or explanation based on the information they've read.
3. **Manage**: If this is more about structuring the conversation or introducing a new point.

Considering the immediate context, where the next utterance begins with ""You stood up for your family and protected them,"" it suggests that the target utterance is part of a setup for a subjective assertion or evaluation of the OP's actions. Therefore, it aligns more closely with a **Claim**, as it indicates the user's intention to make a subjective assertion based on the OP and comments they have read.

The utterance does not specifically provide factual information, request anything, or manage the conversation directly. It's setting up an opinion or reflection, which makes ""Claim"" the most suitable label.

There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts, as this is a straightforward statement of what the speaker has read. Therefore, those fields remain empty.",156,93187
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance ""You stood up for your family and protected them."" is responding to the thread starter's story about defending their sister and mother from an abusive boyfriend. The user is acknowledging the action taken by the thread starter in a positive light. 

Possible communicative acts include:
1. **Congratulate**: The utterance expresses praise for the thread starter's actions, which aligns with congratulating someone for a commendable act.
2. **React**: This could be a positive reaction to the story, showing engagement and approval.

The word choice ""stood up for your family and protected them"" suggests an expression of admiration and recognition of bravery, fitting well with the **Congratulate** act. While it could be seen as a positive reaction, the specific praise-oriented language leans more towards congratulating.

There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance. Therefore, the best label for this utterance is ""Congratulate.""",157,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""My guess is you prevented a lot of pain and suffering."" follows a statement acknowledging the original poster's protective actions towards their family. The user is speculating on the positive outcome of those actions. The phrase ""My guess is"" indicates that this is a subjective assertion, as the user is expressing their own belief or assumption about the situation rather than stating a verifiable fact. Additionally, there is no direct request, command, or inquiry present in the utterance. The user is not agreeing or disagreeing explicitly with any prior statements, nor are they providing additional information or details about the scenario.

Given these observations, the most fitting communicative act for this utterance is ""Claim,"" as it involves making a subjective assertion that cannot be verified. There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness, and no meta-acts such as reported speech or non-bona fide communication are present. Therefore, the annotation will focus on the primary act of claiming.",158,93189
Manage,,,"In this context, the user Kevin-Uxbridge is responding to a discussion about the original poster's past actions involving the shooting of an abusive boyfriend. The previous message suggests that the shooting might have prevented further pain and suffering, implicitly suggesting a positive outcome. The target utterance ""Do i condone murder."" is a rhetorical question that Kevin-Uxbridge seems to be asking themselves or the broader audience. It is immediately followed by ""No."" in the next message, which indicates that the rhetorical question is being used to set up the following assertion.

There are a few possible communicative acts to consider for the target utterance:
1. **Inquire**: This act involves seeking information or clarification. However, given the context and the immediate follow-up with ""No."", it is clear that the speaker is not genuinely seeking information from others.
2. **Claim**: The user might be making a subjective assertion about their stance on murder. However, the question form and immediate negation suggest a different function.
3. **Repair**: This act involves clarification or correction, but there's no indication of correcting a misunderstanding in this case.

The best fitting communicative act is **Manage**, specifically because the rhetorical question serves to organize the speaker's thoughts or to prepare the audience for the declarative statement that follows (""No.""). This use of a rhetorical question to introduce an idea or establish a stance is a way of managing the discourse.

There is no clear use of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance, so those fields will remain empty.",159,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""No."" is a direct response to the previous question ""Do i condone murder."" The word ""No"" is used to express disagreement or a negative response to the inquiry made in the previous message. In the context of communicative acts, this falls under the category of ""Reject"" because the user is rejecting the notion or implication of condoning murder. There is no additional politeness or meta-layer present in this concise response.",160,93187
Manage,,,"To determine the appropriate communicative act for the target utterance ""That having said.."", let's consider the context and possible labels:

1. **Manage**: This label involves organizing, prompting, or focusing the discussion. The phrase ""That having said.."" often serves as a transition, indicating a shift in the conversation or a preparation for a conclusion or new point. It aligns with managing the flow of discourse.

2. **Elaborate**: This label involves explaining or paraphrasing a previous utterance. However, the phrase itself does not provide additional explanation or clarification; instead, it serves more as a segue.

3. **Repair**: This label involves clarifying or correcting a misunderstanding. The phrase ""That having said.."" does not directly clarify or correct anything but rather signals a transition.

Given the context, the preceding utterance ""No."" could indicate disagreement or a negative stance, and the next utterance ""i salute you!"" suggests a shift to a positive or respectful note. The target phrase is functioning to manage this transition in tone and focus.

Therefore, the most fitting label for ""That having said.."" is **Manage**, as it helps in organizing the conversation and transitioning between contrasting statements. There is no clear expression of politeness or meta-act needed here.",161,93187
Congratulate,+P,,"The target utterance ""i salute you!"" follows a statement that implies respect or acknowledgment of a previous action or statement. In the context of this discussion, the phrase ""I salute you"" is typically used to express admiration or respect for someone's actions or courage. This aligns with the communicative act of congratulating, as it is a form of expressing praise or good wishes, even though it is not a direct congratulation on an achievement. Additionally, given the context, this utterance carries a positive connotation and can be seen as an expression of solidarity or support. Therefore, it may also involve positive politeness. The subsequent message, ""Wish you all the best,"" further supports the interpretation that the speaker is expressing goodwill and respect.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Congratulate"" with positive politeness (+P) because it expresses admiration and respect for the user’s past actions. The act of saluting someone in this way is not a common congratulatory phrase, but it fits within the broader category of expressing respect and goodwill.",162,93187
Greet,+P,,"In this context, the user Kevin-Uxbridge is responding to a story shared by another user. The previous message is an expression of respect (""i salute you!"") towards the story shared by the original poster, which implies admiration or acknowledgment of their actions. The target utterance ""Wish you all the best."" is a standalone expression that conveys goodwill or positive intentions towards the recipient. 

This expression fits the ""Greet"" category, specifically as a well-wishing remark. The act of wishing someone well is a form of greeting that shows positive intentions. It is not a direct request for information or action, nor does it provide factual information or express a subjective opinion. Instead, it is an expression of desire for positive outcomes for the other person.

Politeness is also present here as positive politeness because it shows solidarity and support for the recipient. It is a supportive gesture that aligns with the previous user's salute and maintains a positive interaction tone. There are no indications of sarcasm or irony, so no meta-acts are needed.

Therefore, the best label for this utterance is ""Greet"" with positive politeness.",163,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is a question asking how the user got caught if there were no witnesses. The speaker is seeking information from the original poster about the circumstances of their arrest. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Inquire,"" as it involves seeking information. The context with the previous and next messages supports that this is an inquiry, as it follows a well-wishing message and precedes another user expressing a similar thought, indicating a shared curiosity or uncertainty about the situation. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or irony. Therefore, the label for this utterance is ""Inquire.""",164,93187
React,,,"The target utterance ""That thought crossed my mind, too."" is a response to the previous question, ""as there were no witnesses how did you get caught."" The target utterance acknowledges that the thought of how the user got caught without witnesses is a valid question and was something they also considered. 

The possible communicative acts are:
1. **React**: This would apply if the utterance is merely showing engagement or acknowledgment of the previous statement without adding new information.
2. **Accept**: This could apply if the utterance is agreeing with the implication that it was surprising or unusual that they were caught without witnesses.

The utterance does not provide any new factual information or clarify the previous question, so it doesn't fit **Inform** or **Repair**. It is also not making a subjective assertion, so it doesn't fit **Claim**.

In this context, the utterance ""That thought crossed my mind, too."" is primarily expressing acknowledgment and engagement with the previous statement, indicating that the speaker had the same thought. Therefore, the best fit is **React**. There is no politeness or meta-act clearly expressed here.

Thus, the most appropriate label for this utterance is **React**.",165,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is asking whether a ballistics report could determine the type of gun used in the shooting. This is framed as a question, which suggests that the speaker is seeking information. Let's evaluate potential labels:

1. **Inquire**: This label is used when someone seeks information, typically through a question. The utterance ""Wouldn’t a ballistics report determine what type of gun?"" is clearly a question seeking to confirm or gain information about the capabilities of a ballistics report.

2. **Claim**: This label is used for subjective assertions. The utterance could be interpreted as an indirect claim or suggestion about the capabilities of ballistics reports. However, the phrasing as a question indicates an inquiry rather than a statement.

Given that the utterance is in the form of a question and the user seems to be seeking clarification or confirmation, the most fitting label is **Inquire**. There is no clear politeness or meta-act expressed in this utterance. Therefore, the final annotation is:

- Act: Inquire
- Politeness: None
- Meta: None",166,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Idk how his friend didn’t get caught too if it was his."" is expressing a thought or question about the situation. The user is reflecting on the possibility of the friend's involvement being detected due to ownership of the gun. This utterance does not directly seek information, as it is phrased more as a reflection on the information already provided. It is more of a claim about their uncertainty regarding the friend's situation. The use of ""Idk"" (I don't know) indicates a lack of knowledge or understanding, rather than a direct request for more information. Given this, the most fitting label is Claim, as the user is expressing a subjective assertion about their lack of understanding of how the friend's involvement was not discovered. This utterance does not exhibit any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness, nor does it involve sarcasm or reported speech, so no additional tags are needed.",167,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""Illegal gun."" is responding to the previous comment expressing confusion about why the friend's involvement wasn't detected. The context suggests that the illegality of the gun is being presented as a fact that explains why it wouldn't be traced back to the friend. The next utterance further supports this explanation by stating ""Wouldn’t have traced back to him."" This implies that the gun being illegal is part of the reasoning.

Considering potential communicative acts:
1. **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about the nature of the gun, which is that it was illegal. This fits the definition of providing verifiable factual information.
2. **Claim**: It could be seen as making a subjective assertion, but the context suggests a factual explanation rather than an unverifiable opinion or belief.

Given the context and the nature of the statement, ""Inform"" is the most fitting label as it aims to convey factual information that explains the situation. There is no indication of politeness or meta aspects such as sarcasm. Therefore, the best label is ""Inform"" with no additional politeness or meta tags.",168,93188
Claim,,,"In this utterance, the user is making a statement about the gun used in the incident, suggesting that it wouldn't have been traced back to the friend. The statement ""Wouldn’t have traced back to him"" implies a belief or understanding about the situation. Let's evaluate potential labels:

1. **Claim**: This label could apply as the statement reflects the user's opinion or belief about the traceability of the gun. It is not presented as verifiable information, but rather as the user's subjective understanding of the situation.

2. **Inform**: This label might fit if the user is providing factual information about the nature of the gun and its lack of traceability. However, given the context, the statement seems more like an assertion than a verifiable fact.

Given that the utterance is an assertion about the traceability of the gun, it aligns more closely with a **Claim** rather than an **Inform**. The user's statement reflects a subjective belief rather than a verifiable fact. Additionally, there are no clear indications of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is **Claim**.",169,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Who wanted this guy dead?"" appears to be a rhetorical question. It's following a statement about how the action wouldn't have traced back to the shooter, implying that there was a motive or reason why someone would want the abusive boyfriend dead. In this context, the question is likely used to emphasize the implication that there was a clear motive, rather than genuinely seeking an answer. This implies that the speaker is making a point or drawing attention to the obviousness of the situation. 

I considered the possible communicative acts:
1. **Inquire**: This would be applicable if the speaker were genuinely seeking information. However, given the context, it seems more rhetorical.
2. **Claim**: The speaker could be making an implicit claim about the situation, suggesting that there was a clear reason for the action.
3. **Reject**: The speaker might be challenging the notion that there was no motive or that it was difficult to trace back.

Given the rhetorical nature of the question, the utterance fits best as a **Claim**, as it implicitly suggests that there was an obvious motive, and the question is a way to highlight that fact. 

Since it's a rhetorical question, it should be marked as [non-bona fide]. There are no clear politeness or impoliteness elements present.",170,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""would probably solve the problem"" appears to be a continuation or a response to the previous message, ""Who wanted this guy dead?"" The statement seems to suggest that the death of the person in question would address or resolve an issue. The use of ""probably"" indicates speculation or a hypothetical scenario. The next message, ""unless he voluntary gave himself up a case needs to be built up,"" discusses a legal perspective, implying the need for evidence unless the person surrenders voluntarily.

Considering the communicative-act labels:
1. **Claim**: The utterance could be making a subjective assertion that the death would solve the problem. This fits the speculative nature of the statement.
2. **Desire**: It could express a wish or hope that the problem would be solved by the death. However, it lacks explicit markers of desire like ""I wish"" or ""I hope.""

Given the context and the speculative nature of the statement, ""Claim"" seems most fitting as it reflects an assertion that is not necessarily verifiable but is a personal viewpoint. The statement doesn't express a direct wish or want but rather a belief about a hypothetical outcome.

Therefore, the most suitable label is ""Claim"" with no clear politeness or meta-acts involved.",171,93189
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""unless he voluntary gave him self up a case needs to be built up"" appears to be providing factual information about legal procedures or norms. It suggests that a case must be constructed unless the individual in question surrenders voluntarily. This is not an opinion or a desire; it is presented as a factual statement about how legal proceedings typically work. 

The context supports this interpretation: the previous utterance ""would probably solve the problem"" and the next utterance ""saying this person is most likely the killer doesn't get you thrown in jail"" both relate to legal processes and outcomes. The target utterance fits as an explanation of why a case needs to be built, reinforcing the idea that it's stating a procedural fact.

Considering these aspects, the most fitting communicative act for the target utterance is ""Inform,"" as it provides information that is verifiable in principle about how cases need to be built legally. There's no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm, so those elements are not applicable here.",172,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance is making a statement about the legal process, specifically about how one is not imprisoned based solely on suspicion or accusations without evidence. It appears to be a factual statement about the requirements for legal action, suggesting that mere suspicion is insufficient for incarceration. This utterance does not show agreement or disagreement with any previous statement but rather seems to be providing a factual clarification or explanation regarding the legal process.

1. **Possible Acts:**
   - **Inform**: The utterance is providing factual information about the legal system's requirements for arrest and imprisonment.
   - **Claim**: The utterance could be a subjective assertion about what is likely or unlikely to happen in legal scenarios, but it appears to be more factual.

2. **Narrowing Down:**
   - **Inform** seems most appropriate as the user states a fact about the legal process, implying a requirement for a case to be built before imprisonment.

3. **Testing Against Context:**
   - The context involves discussing legal actions and evidence, and the next utterance further discusses the lack of witnesses. This supports the interpretation that the target utterance is informing about the need for evidence.

4. **Politeness/Meta Consideration:**
   - There are no clear signs of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement without sarcasm or humor.

Therefore, the most fitting label for the utterance is **Inform**. There are no evident politeness or meta aspects to annotate.",173,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""As he stated first there was no witnesses"" is providing information that references a previous statement made by the original poster about the lack of witnesses in the incident. The use of ""As he stated"" indicates that this information is being attributed to a prior claim or statement by another user, specifically the one who shared the story. 

The main task here is to determine whether this utterance should be labeled as ""Inform"" or ""Repair."" ""Inform"" is used when providing factual information, while ""Repair"" is used when clarifying or correcting a misunderstanding. The phrase ""As he stated"" suggests that the speaker is reiterating or reminding others of a detail that was already mentioned, rather than correcting a misunderstanding or error. The lack of witnesses is a factual detail that plays a significant role in the context of the story being discussed. 

Therefore, the utterance is best categorized as ""Inform,"" as it provides factual information based on the original poster's account, and there is no evidence of misunderstanding being corrected here. The utterance does not exhibit any clear politeness or impoliteness markers, nor does it involve any humor or sarcasm, so no additional tags are needed.",174,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""It should be a pretty significant amount of the story that has been glossed over."" seems to suggest that the speaker believes an important part of the story has been omitted or not adequately addressed. This implies a critique or a challenge to the completeness or accuracy of the story being discussed. 

Possible communicative acts for this utterance could include:
1. **Reject**: The speaker could be rejecting the completeness of the story as it has been presented, suggesting that it is lacking significant details.
2. **Claim**: The speaker might be making a subjective assertion about what they believe is missing from the story.

Given the context:
- The previous utterance notes that there were no witnesses, implying a focus on a specific detail of the story.
- The next utterance contradicts this by stating ""There were witnesses,"" which supports the idea that the story's completeness or accuracy is in question.

The target utterance fits best as a **Reject** because it challenges the narrative as incomplete, suggesting that an important part has been overlooked. This interpretation is reinforced by the subsequent message, which disputes the prior claim about witnesses, indicating ongoing discourse about the story's accuracy.

There are no clear markers of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It appears to be a straightforward critique without additional sarcastic or mocking tones. Therefore, no politeness or meta-act tags are applicable here.",175,93189
Inform,,,"The utterance ""There were witnesses."" is providing a piece of factual information related to the story being discussed. The previous message mentions that a significant part of the story has been glossed over, suggesting that important details were omitted. The target utterance fills in one of those details by stating the existence of witnesses, which is verifiable information within the context of the story. The next message elaborates further by specifying the inability of those witnesses to identify another person involved. Given this context, the most appropriate communicative act for the target utterance is ""Inform,"" as it is providing factual information about the situation.",176,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""None of them were able to identify the other person"" is providing information about the situation. The previous message ""There were witnesses"" sets up a context where witnesses were present, but the target utterance clarifies that these witnesses could not identify someone, presumably the friend mentioned in the original post. The next utterance ""Because the guy died …??"" seems to question or challenge the given information, possibly suggesting disbelief or confusion.

Considering the communicative acts:
1. **Inform**: The target utterance provides factual information about the witnesses' inability to identify the other person involved. This fits well since the statement is conveying a specific, verifiable detail.
2. **Claim**: While the statement could be seen as a claim since it's about an event in the past, it is more factual in nature given the context.

After evaluating both possibilities, ""Inform"" is the most fitting label as the utterance is presenting a factual detail regarding the situation. There are no clear politeness or meta-acts indicated in this utterance.",177,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""Because the guy died …??"" appears to be a response to the previous statement, ""None of them were able to identify the other person."" The user is questioning or challenging the logic behind why the other person wasn't identified, suggesting that it might be because the victim died and thus could not identify anyone. This utterance implies some skepticism or disbelief.

1. **Possible Acts:**
   - **Reject**: The user could be challenging the logic of the previous statement, indicating that the reason no one was identified was due to the victim's death, which the previous statement didn't account for.
   - **React**: The user could simply be reacting to the information with a hint of disbelief or surprise.

2. **Narrowing Down:**
   - **Reject** is more suitable because the use of ""Because"" followed by a questioning tone (""…??"") implies a challenge to the reasoning provided in the previous utterance. The user seems to be pointing out a flaw or an overlooked factor in the reasoning.

3. **Politeness and Meta-Acts:**
   - The use of ""…??"" suggests an informal, possibly sarcastic tone, but there's no explicit impoliteness. The act might be rhetorical or non-bona fide, given the use of ellipses and question marks.

Considering the context and the structure of the utterance, **Reject** fits best, possibly with a **[non-bona fide]** tag given the questioning tone, indicating that the user might not be seeking information but rather highlighting an inconsistency in reasoning.",178,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""And they always look at family relations first"" appears to be making a general statement about how investigations typically proceed in cases involving a death. The user is noting a common procedure or practice in law enforcement, which is to first examine those closest to the victim, such as family members. 

Two possible communicative acts could be:
1. **Inform**: The user is providing information about standard investigative procedures, which is verifiable as a common practice in real-world scenarios.
2. **Claim**: The user might be expressing a subjective assertion based on personal belief or understanding of how investigations are conducted, which might not be objectively verifiable in all contexts.

Given the context, the most appropriate label is **Inform**. The statement is presented as if it is factual and widely recognized, rather than merely an opinion or personal belief. There is no politeness or meta-act explicitly present in this utterance. Therefore, the annotation will reflect the act of providing factual information.",179,93187
Reject,-P,,"The target utterance ""and no doubt this guy gave himself up right OP"" appears to be a rhetorical question rather than a genuine inquiry. The phrase ""no doubt"" suggests that the user is expressing skepticism or disbelief regarding the situation described by the original poster (OP). This implies that the user is not actually seeking information but rather making a sarcastic comment on the improbability of the scenario where the OP would have voluntarily given themselves up. 

Considering the options:
1. **Inquire**: Would be applicable if the user were genuinely seeking an answer, but the use of ""no doubt"" indicates otherwise.
2. **Reject**: This could fit as the user is implicitly disagreeing with the notion that the OP might have given themselves up.
3. **React**: This doesn't fit well since the utterance seems more about disbelief rather than a simple reaction.

The rhetorical nature of the question and the skepticism conveyed by ""no doubt"" suggest that **Reject** is the most appropriate label, as it reflects a challenge to the credibility of the scenario presented by the OP.

The utterance also carries an element of sarcasm, suggesting the use of the [non-bona fide] tag.

Given this reasoning, the best fit is:
- Act: Reject
- Politeness: –P [non-bona fide] due to the sarcastic tone.",180,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""there just seems to be a large chunk of the story that is glossed over"" is expressing the user's perception that an important part of the story is missing or not fully explained. This is a subjective observation about the completeness of the story, rather than a factual statement that can be verified. 

In considering possible communicative acts, ""Claim"" and ""Reject"" are potential options. ""Claim"" is applicable because the user is making a subjective assertion about the story's completeness. This assertion is based on their perception, which cannot be definitively verified. ""Reject"" could be considered if the user were directly disputing a specific part of the story, but here the focus is on the overall narrative being incomplete, not on denying a specific fact.

Given the context, ""Claim"" is the most appropriate label because the user is presenting their personal assessment of the situation. There are no clear politeness or meta-communication elements in this utterance.

Therefore, the most fitting annotation is ""Claim"" with no additional politeness or meta tags.",181,93187
Behave,,,"In this context, the user is commenting on the original post about the user's past experience with shooting someone and serving juvenile time. The previous message mentions that a large chunk of the story was glossed over, implying that there is a part of the story that wasn't given enough attention. The target utterance suggests that the part about being caught should have been a more significant portion of the narrative.

Possible communicative acts include:

1. **Behave**: The user might be implying that there is an expectation or norm that the story should have focused more on the part about being caught.
2. **Claim**: The user could be making a subjective assertion that the story should have been different, focusing more on the being caught part.

The most fitting act seems to be **Behave**, as the user is calling attention to a social expectation or norm regarding storytelling, particularly in stories involving crime and capture, where the capture or being caught is often a focal point. The user suggests that this part of the story was expected to take up more narrative space.

The politeness or meta-acts are not clearly expressed, so they are not included.

Thus, the best annotation is ""Behave"".",182,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance is providing an opinion about what individuals in jail likely focus on, specifically the way they got caught and detected. This is a subjective statement about the thought process of people in jail and cannot be verified. It is not directly responding to any previous utterance with agreement or disagreement, nor is it providing factual information or asking for any. Therefore, the most fitting communicative act here is ""Claim,"" as it expresses the user's personal view about the mental processing of individuals in jail. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.",183,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""I haven’t been on this account in a while,"" is a standalone statement that does not directly respond to the previous message about processing how one got caught in jail. It is a self-reflective statement indicating a lapse in activity or presence on a particular account. This utterance is not providing any new verifiable information, nor is it seeking information or reacting to the previous message. It is simply stating a subjective experience or situation of the speaker. The act that best describes this utterance is ""Claim,"" as it is making a subjective assertion about the speaker's activity on the account. There are no politeness or meta-acts evident in this straightforward statement.",184,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance is responding to a question or comment about the nature of the crime committed by JuvieThrowaw. The phrase ""I didn’t do my crime sneakily"" is a declaration about how the crime was carried out, specifically that it was not done in a secretive manner. This is a straightforward statement providing factual information about the circumstances of the crime. Considering the taxonomy, ""Inform"" is the most appropriate communicative act because the user is supplying verifiable factual information about their past actions. There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance, and there is no non-bona fide language present. Therefore, no politeness or meta tags are needed.",185,93188
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""It was daylight (evening, so dimmed, but still daylight)"" provides specific information about the time of day when the event occurred. This is a factual statement, meant to clarify or provide context to the previous assertion that the crime wasn't done sneakily. The previous utterance mentions the nature of the crime and its lack of sneakiness, and the next utterance continues to provide more context about the neighborhood. Given this, the most fitting communicative act is ""Inform,"" as the user is providing verifiable details about the circumstances of the event. There is no indication of politeness or non-bona fide intent in this straightforward factual statement.",186,93187
Inform,,,"In this utterance, the user is providing additional context to the narrative they are sharing. They are explaining that people in the neighborhood knew them, likely as a way to set up the context for the event they are describing. The statement provides factual information about the familiarity of the neighborhood with them and their family. The use of ""sometimes me and my family would go over there"" implies a habitual action, which is verifiable and factual in the context of the story they are telling. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Inform,"" as it adds context and detail to the narrative by providing a piece of factual information. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm in this utterance.",187,93187
Inform,,,"In the target utterance, ""but they didn’t know my friend,"" the speaker, JuvieThrowaw, is providing additional information related to his previous statement about people in the neighborhood knowing him but not his friend. The context indicates that this information is used to explain why his friend was not implicated in the shooting. This utterance is factual and extends the previous point about neighborhood familiarity, aligning with the communicative act of ""Inform."" There is no politeness or meta-act element present in this utterance, as it is straightforward factual information without sarcasm or reported speech.",188,93187
Inform,,,"In the target utterance, ""and I didn’t give him up,"" the user is stating that they did not reveal their friend's involvement or identity to the authorities. Several communicative acts could be considered here:

1. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle. The statement could be seen as a claim about the user's actions and decision not to disclose information.

2. **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. The user is providing a fact about what they did in the situation.

3. **Reject**: This act involves disagreement or refusal. The user is refusing to provide information, but this isn't an outright disagreement.

Considering the context, the user is recounting a series of events related to their legal situation. The statement is a straightforward recount of their decision not to reveal their friend's involvement. It provides factual information about their past actions in the context of the story. Therefore, the best-fitting label is **Inform** because the user is providing factual information about their actions, specifically not giving up their friend.

There are no clear markers of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there an indication of sarcasm or humor. The statement is direct and factual. Thus, no additional politeness or meta tags are applicable here.",189,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""The gun wouldn’t be traced to my friend"" is part of a sequence explaining why the speaker did not give up their friend. The surrounding context involves discussing the situation surrounding the shooting and the friend's involvement. This utterance provides a factual statement regarding the gun and its traceability. The phrase ""wouldn’t be traced"" is related to the nature of the gun being illegal, which is explained in the next utterance. The act of providing this detail is best categorized as ""Inform"" because it offers a verifiable piece of information about the gun's traceability, contributing to the overall understanding of the situation. There is no expression of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm present in this utterance.",190,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""because it was an illegal gun"" provides a reason or explanation for why the gun wouldn't be traced to the friend's possession. The surrounding context includes statements about the gun's traceability and subsequent actions taken by the friend. 

The possible communicative acts for this utterance include:
1. **Inform**: The user provides factual information about the gun's legal status, which is relevant to understanding why it couldn't be traced.
2. **Elaborate**: The user might be explaining or justifying the previous statement about the gun's untraceability.

Between these options, ""Inform"" seems the most appropriate because the user is providing a specific piece of factual information regarding the gun's status that contributes to understanding the situation. The utterance is not merely expanding on a previous statement but is supplying a concrete fact about the gun's legality.

There are no clear indications of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or humor in this context. The information is presented straightforwardly, without any additional emotional or stylistic elements. Therefore, no politeness or meta tags are applicable here.",191,93187
Claim,,,"In the target utterance, the user is sharing information about the actions of another individual, presumably the friend who provided the gun. The phrase ""from what I heard"" indicates that the user is reporting information that is not directly verified by them, suggesting this is a subjective assertion based on hearsay. 

1. **Claim**: This label is appropriate as the user is making an assertion about someone else's actions, which is unverifiable in principle since it is based on what they ""heard"" rather than witnessed or confirmed directly.

2. **Inform**: If the user were providing factual information that could be verified, this would be the correct label. However, due to the phrase ""from what I heard,"" it lacks the verifiability typical of an inform act.

Given the reliance on hearsay and the subjective nature of the assertion, ""Claim"" is the most fitting label. There are no clear signs of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance.

Therefore, the best choice here is ""Claim"" with no politeness or meta-act tags.",192,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""I was arrested at my moms house."" provides a factual piece of information about the user's past experience. The user is stating where the arrest took place, which is a verifiable fact in the context of the story they are sharing.

In considering possible communicative acts, ""Inform"" is the most fitting because the user is conveying factual information about an event that happened to them. It is not a subjective assertion (which would be a ""Claim""), nor is it a request for information (which would be an ""Inquire""), nor any other act that involves directing behavior or managing interaction.

There is no element of politeness or impoliteness present in this utterance, as it is a straightforward factual statement. There are also no meta-acts like reported speech or non-bona fide language.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform"".",193,93187
Desire,,,"The target utterance ""Hope that clears some stuff up"" follows the statement about being arrested at the mother's house. The preceding context involves the user narrating their experience of being involved in a serious situation that led to their arrest. The use of ""Hope"" suggests a desire that the previous explanation has clarified any confusion or questions others might have had about the circumstances of the arrest. 

In terms of communicative acts, the utterance could be considered a **Desire** because it expresses a wish or hope that the information provided has resolved any misunderstandings or questions. The user isn't directly informing or explaining but rather expressing a hope or wish regarding the outcome of their previous explanation. 

Another possibility could be **Manage**, as it might be seen as an attempt to organize or close off a line of questioning by indicating that enough information has been provided. However, the explicit use of ""Hope"" aligns more with expressing a desire or wish rather than managing the discussion.

Given these considerations, **Desire** fits best because it captures the user's expression of hope about the adequacy of the explanation. There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts in this specific utterance, so those will not be annotated.",194,93187
Reject,-P,,"In the target utterance, the user expresses strong disapproval regarding the charge of murder given the context of the story shared by the original poster. The phrase ""What an insult"" indicates that the user finds the charge inappropriate or disrespectful in light of the abusive situation described. The word choice ""this sack of shit"" to refer to the mother's abusive boyfriend further emphasizes the user's disdain for the boyfriend's actions and the perceived injustice of the legal outcome.

The communicative act here is primarily one of expressing disagreement or challenge to the decision of charging the individual with murder. This aligns with the ""Reject"" label, as the user is contesting the appropriateness of the legal charge.

Additionally, the use of derogatory language like ""sack of shit"" indicates a violation of positive politeness norms, as it shows a lack of respect and is insulting. This can be classified under –P [Insult].

Given these considerations, the appropriate labels are ""Reject"" for the communicative act and –P [Insult] for the politeness annotation.",195,93187
Inquire,,,"The target utterance is asking a question about the user's feelings towards the justice system for punishing them. The question seems to seek information about the user's emotional response to their punishment, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Inquire."" The context provided by the previous and next utterances supports this interpretation. The previous utterance expresses strong emotions against the murder charge, potentially prompting the user to reflect on their feelings about the justice system. The next utterance (""Yes and no."") is a direct response, indicating that the target utterance's primary function is to elicit information. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting, so these are not applicable in this context.",196,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance ""Yes and no."" is a response to a question about whether the user is angry with the justice system for punishing them. The user provides a partial agreement and partial disagreement, indicating a nuanced stance. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Accept,"" as it partially concurs with the notion of being angry, but also implies some disagreement or ambivalence. The context suggests that the user acknowledges both sides of the issue, which is characteristic of an ""Accept"" act with some reservation. There are no explicit politeness or meta-act indicators in this short response. Therefore, ""Accept"" is the most fitting label for this response.",197,93187
Elaborate,,,"The target utterance is an explanation given by the user ""JuvieThrowaw"" in response to a prior message. The user states, ""I went to him, so it was premeditated, not an act of active defense,"" which provides additional context or clarification about their actions. The phrase ""I went to him"" suggests a deliberate decision, and the user contrasts this with the idea of ""active defense,"" implying a difference between a planned action and a spontaneous defensive reaction.

Considering possible communicative acts:
1. **Inform**: This act involves providing factual information. The user is explaining the nature of their actions, which could be seen as providing factual context.
2. **Elaborate**: This act involves explaining or paraphrasing a previous utterance, often to clarify or expand upon it. The user is elaborating on their initial statement about the nature of the action, providing more detail about why it was considered premeditated.

Given that the user is clarifying a point about the nature of their actions in response to a previous statement, ""Yes and no,"" the most fitting label is **Elaborate**. This is because the user is expanding on their reasoning, providing a deeper explanation of their actions as premeditated rather than defensive.

There is no clear indication of politeness or meta-acts in this utterance. It is a straightforward elaboration without sarcasm or reported speech. Therefore, no additional tags are necessary.",198,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance ""I get it."" follows the user's acknowledgment of committing a premeditated act rather than one in active defense. It expresses understanding or agreement with the preceding statement about the nature of the act. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Accept,"" as the user is concurring with the characterization of the event as premeditated. The next utterance expresses a desire regarding the sentencing outcome, which is separate from the target utterance's acceptance of the premeditated nature of the act. There are no indicators of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reported speech in the target utterance. Therefore, the most fitting label for ""I get it."" is ""Accept.""",199,93187
Desire,,,"In the target utterance, the user expresses a wish regarding the sentencing they received. The key word here is ""wish,"" which indicates a desire for a different outcome. The utterance is not providing factual information, requesting action, or reacting to another statement, which rules out acts like ""Inform,"" ""Request,"" or ""React."" The structure of the sentence, starting with ""Thought I wish,"" clearly conveys a hope or desire for an alternate reality, aligning it with the communicative act of ""Desire."" There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness present in the statement, nor is it sarcastic or rhetorical, so no additional politeness or meta tags are needed.",200,93188
Apologize,+P,,"In the target utterance, the user, Savings_Peak5408, expresses sympathy towards both the original poster's family and the family of the person who was fatally shot. This expression of sympathy aligns with the communicative-act label of ""Apologize,"" as it involves humbling oneself and expressing regret or sorrow for the situation. It doesn't fit the ""Thank"" act since there's no gratitude expressed, nor does it fit ""Congratulate"" or ""Greet,"" as there's no praise or well-wishing involved. The apology here is meant to show empathy and understanding of the difficult circumstances faced by both families. Additionally, there is a component of positive politeness (+P) as the user is showing support and solidarity by acknowledging the hardship both families went through. There's no evidence of sarcasm or irony, so no ""non-bona fide"" meta-act is necessary.",201,93187
Claim,-P,,"The target utterance expresses a judgment about the fairness of the situation, specifically regarding the user's time spent in detention. This is a subjective evaluation, indicating a personal perspective or opinion about the fairness of the user's legal consequences. The phrase ""It seems so unfair"" is key here, as it reflects a personal stance rather than a factual statement or an inquiry. It doesn't provide verifiable information, nor does it request action or information. Instead, it makes a subjective assertion about the fairness of the situation.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate communicative-act label for this utterance is ""Claim,"" as it reflects a subjective assertion or opinion about the fairness of the user's experience.",202,93188
Inquire,,,"The target utterance from Savings_Peak5408 is a question directed at the original poster (""Did your lawyer fight hard to defend you?""). This is a direct request for information. The user is inquiring about the effort made by the lawyer in defending the case, which fits the definition of ""Inquire"" as it seeks information.

Examining the context, the previous message expresses an opinion about the fairness of the situation, and the next message provides an answer to the inquiry, indicating that the target utterance successfully elicited a response. There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness beyond the straightforward nature of the question, so no additional tags are needed.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate label for the target utterance is ""Inquire.""",203,93189
Elaborate,,,"The target utterance is a response to a question about whether the user's lawyer fought hard to defend him. The user begins with ""Yes,"" indicating agreement or concurrence with the idea that his lawyer did fight hard. However, the user then provides additional context about why the defense was challenging, noting that his actions were premeditated rather than an active defense. This additional context is an elaboration on why the outcome might not have been favorable despite the lawyer's efforts.

Possible communicative acts include:
1. **Accept**: The user agrees with the notion that his lawyer fought hard, as indicated by ""Yes.""
2. **Elaborate**: The user provides further explanation about the nature of his actions and how they affected the legal defense.

The most fitting label for the target utterance is **Elaborate** because the user is not only concurring but also providing a detailed explanation about the nature of his actions and their implications for the legal defense. The initial ""Yes"" is part of a more complex response that primarily serves to explain his understanding of the situation. This explanation is more central to the utterance than the simple agreement.

There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any non-bona fide communication or reporting. Thus, those tags are not applicable here.",204,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance ""so I understand from a judicial standpoint"" follows the previous message where the user discusses the nature of their actions being premeditated rather than an act of active defense. The user is expressing an understanding or acceptance of the judicial perspective on their actions. This utterance does not provide new factual information, nor does it make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. Instead, it reflects the user's acknowledgment of the judicial view, indicating a form of acceptance of the situation as it is interpreted by the law. This understanding aligns with the communicative act of ""Accept,"" as the user is agreeing or acquiescing to the judicial standpoint regarding their actions. There are no elements of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any meta-commentary present in this utterance. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Accept.""",205,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance ""That makes sense."" is a response to the previous statement ""so I understand from a judicial standpoint."" In this context, the user is expressing agreement or acceptance of the explanation or viewpoint provided in the previous message. The phrase ""That makes sense"" typically indicates that the user finds the explanation logical or reasonable, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Accept."" There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or irony in this straightforward agreement. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Accept.""",206,93187
Desire,+P,,"The target utterance is ""I hope the rest of your life is fantastic!"" The user is expressing a positive sentiment towards the future of the thread starter. This expression aligns with the communicative act of ""Desire,"" as it conveys a hope or wish for someone's well-being. The sentiment is clearly positive and supportive, which could also indicate a form of positive politeness. The context supports this as the previous message acknowledges understanding (""That makes sense""), and the next message continues to reinforce the positive impact of the thread starter's actions (""Your sacrifice saved your mom and sisters life""). This further supports that the target is an expression of goodwill and hope, fitting under ""Desire"" with a positive politeness marker. There are no indications of non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm, so no additional meta tags are necessary.",207,93187
Congratulate,,,"In this context, the user is responding to the original poster's story about a traumatic event in their past. The prior message expresses a wish for a positive future, which aligns with support and encouragement. The target message is affirming the positive impact of the user's actions, emphasizing the significance of their past actions in a supportive manner.

Considering possible communicative acts:
1. **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement. While the target utterance does highlight the positive outcome of the user's actions, it does not explicitly express praise or good wishes for an achievement in the usual sense (e.g., a completed task or achievement like graduation).
   
2. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. The statement could be interpreted as a subjective view on the impact of the user's actions, but it is more than just an assertion. It is intended to provide reassurance and support.

3. **Thank**: This act involves expressing gratitude. The target message acknowledges the user's actions in a positive light, but it doesn't specifically express gratitude directly.

Given the context and the supportive nature of the statement, the most fitting act is **Congratulate**, as the user is emphasizing the positive outcome of the user's actions, which can be seen as a form of praise or acknowledgment of the significance of those actions. The statement, while not a traditional congratulatory message, serves to uplift and commend the user's past difficult decision.

There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any indication of sarcasm or non-bona fide communication. Therefore, no additional tags for politeness or meta-acts are necessary.",208,93190
Congratulate,,,"The target utterance ""They are happy and doing well because of your actions that day."" follows a statement recognizing the user's sacrifice and precedes a comment that low-key labels the user as a hero. The statement seems to be a continuation of expressing appreciation or acknowledgment of the positive outcome resulting from the user's actions.

Considering the potential communicative acts:
1. **Congratulate**: This act involves expressing praise or good wishes for an achievement. The statement highlights the positive outcome (""They are happy and doing well"") directly linked to the user's actions. While not a traditional congratulation, it does attribute a positive result to the user's actions, aligning with a congratulatory tone.
2. **Inform**: This act would involve providing factual information. While the statement presents the outcome as fact, it is more of an appreciative acknowledgment rather than merely providing information.
3. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. The statement is indeed an assertion, but it is tied closely to recognizing the user's positive impact, which leans more toward congratulating.

Given the context and the immediate focus on the user's positive impact, the best-fitting label is **Congratulate**, as it recognizes and praises the outcome of the user's actions. There is no explicit politeness or meta-act, so those are left empty.",209,93189
Claim,,,"In the target utterance, ""Lowkey ur kind of a hero imo,"" the user is expressing a subjective opinion or belief about the original poster's actions. The phrase ""in my opinion"" (imo) explicitly signals that this is a subjective assertion rather than a factual statement. The use of ""lowkey"" implies an understated or modest form of praise, but it still conveys a sense of admiration or recognition of the original poster's actions. The act of expressing personal belief or viewpoint aligns with the communicative act of ""Claim,"" where the user is making a subjective assertion about the original poster being a hero. There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness present, and no meta-acts are applicable in this context. Therefore, the best-fitting label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",210,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""Ehh not really."" is a response to the previous message, ""Lowkey ur kind of a hero imo."" This previous message expresses an opinion or subjective assertion, praising the original poster for their actions. The target utterance, ""Ehh not really,"" is a mild rejection of this praise. It implies disagreement with the notion of being considered a hero. The use of ""Ehh"" suggests a casual or understated tone, but the essence of the message is to dispute the characterization provided by the previous user. The next message continues the theme of discussing the actions but doesn't change the interpretation of the target utterance. Therefore, the most appropriate label for ""Ehh not really."" is ""Reject."" There is no clear politeness or meta-act to annotate, as the rejection is mild and doesn't include any impolite elements or sarcasm.",211,93188
Claim,-P,,"The target utterance expresses a subjective opinion about the situation described by the original poster. It makes an assertion about the boyfriend being an ""asshole"" and evaluates the action of committing a felony as one of the worst choices, suggesting that there were better solutions available. This utterance does not provide verifiable information; rather, it expresses the speaker's judgment about the situation, which aligns with the definition of a ""Claim."" The next utterance further elaborates on alternative solutions, which supports the interpretation that the target utterance is expressing a subjective viewpoint about the available solutions rather than informing or directing. Thus, the most fitting label for the target utterance is ""Claim.""",212,93190
Inform,,,"The target utterance suggests the existence of services to help with abusive situations, even in rural areas. This is presented as a factual assertion, implying that such services are available and accessible. The context of the discussion involves offering alternative solutions to handling abuse, suggesting that the commenter is providing factual information to support their argument that there are better ways to handle the situation than committing a crime.

The two possible communicative acts to consider are:

1. **Inform**: The user provides factual information about the availability of services for abusive situations, which is verifiable and objective.
2. **Claim**: The user makes a subjective assertion about the availability of services, which may not be universally true or verifiable.

Given the context and the nature of the statement, ""Inform"" is more appropriate, as the user appears to be providing information to counter the idea that there were no other options available. The statement is presented as factual and verifiable, fitting the criteria for ""Inform.""

There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any non-bona fide element like sarcasm or humor in the utterance. Therefore, the annotation should focus solely on the communicative act.

Thus, the best fitting label for this utterance is ""Inform.""",213,93188
Direct,,,"The target utterance suggests an alternative course of action to the original poster (OP) regarding how to handle the abusive boyfriend situation. The user is recommending that OP should try to have the abusive boyfriend legally locked up, rather than taking matters into their own hands. This is presented as a preferable option that would not result in consequences for OP.

Considering the communicative act labels:
1. **Direct**: This label involves an attempt to cause action, such as requiring, prohibiting, or advising strongly. The phrase ""Try instead to get the abusive bf locked up"" is a clear attempt to advise OP on what action to take.
2. **Request**: This could fit if the utterance was more of a polite suggestion or seeking help, but the directive nature of the language used leans more towards a strong recommendation rather than a polite request.

The utterance does not contain elements of politeness or impoliteness, as it focuses on advising a course of action without any hedging or mitigating language.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting label is **Direct** as the user is strongly advising OP on an alternative course of action. There are no clear politeness or meta-acts present.",214,93189
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""There’s also the fact the abusive bf’s family exists."" appears to contribute to an ongoing discussion about the consequences of the original poster's actions. The user who made this utterance is likely acknowledging the broader implications of the situation, specifically the impact on the family of the abusive boyfriend. 

The previous utterance suggests an alternative course of action that OP could have taken, implying that it might have been less harmful. The target utterance seems to be expanding on this point by highlighting the existence of the abusive boyfriend’s family, suggesting that they too are part of the equation and could be affected negatively by his death.

This utterance could potentially be labeled as ""Inform,"" as it provides factual information about the existence of the family. However, the existence of the family is not new information or verifiable in the context of this discussion. 

Alternatively, it could be a ""Claim,"" as it expresses a subjective assertion that the family’s existence is relevant to the moral evaluation of OP’s actions. This seems to fit better, as the utterance does not provide new factual information but rather brings attention to a consideration that might not have been addressed in the previous suggestions.

Given the context and nature of the utterance, ""Claim"" is the most fitting label, as it introduces a subjective element into the conversation about OP's actions and their consequences. There are no clear politeness or meta-acts indicators in this utterance, so those remain empty.

Thus, the best fitting label for the target utterance is ""Claim.""",215,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""They didn’t deserve to suffer a loss, even if the murder victim wasn’t a great person."" expresses a subjective viewpoint or opinion regarding the situation. It acknowledges that despite the negative aspects of the murder victim's character, the family of the victim did not deserve to experience the loss of their loved one. This statement is inherently subjective because it involves a value judgment about what people ""deserve,"" which is not objectively verifiable. 

The two possible communicative acts here could be:

1. **Claim** - The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the situation. This fits because the statement involves a personal value judgment about the deservingness of the victim's family.
2. **Inform** - This would apply if the speaker were providing factual information. However, this is not the case here, as the statement is not about verifiable facts but rather about a moral perspective.

Given that the utterance is a subjective moral assertion about the deservingness of the victim's family, the best fitting communicative act is **Claim**. There is no clear politeness or meta aspect expressed in this utterance. 

Therefore, the label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",216,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance by ""jesusgrandpa"" seems to be responding to the previous message that implies a non-violent approach might have been a better choice. The sentence ""Follow this advice and the bf gets one night in jail and a court date and your family is dead"" is a strong statement that predicts a severe consequence if a certain course of action is taken. This utterance doesn't agree with the previous statement but rather presents an alternative, undesirable outcome, suggesting that the advice given would lead to a worse situation. The act here is not simply informing because it's not about providing factual information but making a speculative assertion about what could have happened. The best fitting label for this is ""Claim,"" as it's presenting a subjective assertion about potential outcomes. Additionally, there's an implicit critique of the previous advice, which could be considered a mild form of rejection or a challenge to the previous statement, but it primarily fits under ""Claim"" due to its speculative nature. There is no clear politeness or meta-act in this utterance.",217,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""Not necessarily."" directly responds to the previous statement, which suggests that following certain advice will inevitably lead to the boyfriend spending one night in jail and the family being harmed. The phrase ""Not necessarily"" serves to challenge or dispute this assertion, indicating that the outcome described is not a guaranteed consequence. The next utterance provides an alternative perspective or solution, suggesting that restraining orders and legal separation could be options, further supporting the idea that the initial outcome is not certain.

Considering the options:
1. **Reject**: This label fits as the user is disagreeing with the previous statement's certainty about the negative outcome.
2. **Repair**: This could fit if the user was clarifying a misunderstanding, but here they are not correcting a misunderstanding; they are disputing a claim.
3. **React**: This would be more about showing engagement rather than explicitly disagreeing.

Given the context, ""Reject"" seems the most appropriate label because the user is explicitly challenging the assertion made in the previous utterance.

There are no clear markers of politeness or meta-acts in the utterance. It is a straightforward disagreement.",218,93187
Direct,,,"The target utterance ""You can get restraining orders and legally separate from the bf."" appears to be providing advice or suggesting a course of action. The user is offering a solution to the situation described in the context, which involves dealing with an abusive boyfriend. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Direct,"" where the speaker attempts to cause an action by advising or suggesting a particular course of action. The previous message, ""Not necessarily,"" seems to challenge or reject an earlier point, and the following message, ""And with that, OP’s family would not be in danger,"" supports the advice given, indicating that the suggestion could lead to a positive outcome. This confirms that the target utterance is indeed a directive to take certain legal actions. There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness markers in the utterance, nor any non-bona fide elements. Therefore, the most fitting label is ""Direct"" with no additional tags needed.",219,93187
Accept,,,"The target utterance is a direct response to the previous message, which suggests that getting a restraining order and legally separating from the boyfriend would protect the family. The speaker agrees with this suggestion by stating that taking such legal actions would indeed ensure the family's safety. This agreement is implicit in the statement ""And with that, OP’s family would not be in danger,"" which reinforces the idea that the proposed legal measures would be effective. The communicative act here is thus one of agreement with the previous suggestion. The politeness or meta-act elements do not seem to apply as there is no explicit positive politeness, negative politeness, or non-bona fide communication. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Accept.""",220,93188
Reject,,,"The target utterance states, ""Plus, you can’t murder out of speculation that your family would be in danger otherwise."" This comment appears to challenge the justification of committing murder based on speculative danger. The user is countering the idea that potential harm to the family could justify the violent act. 

1. **Claim**: This would involve making a subjective assertion, but the statement is framed as a factual prohibition (""you can’t murder""), which doesn’t align with a subjective claim.
   
2. **Reject**: The user is disputing the notion that speculative danger is a valid justification for murder. This aligns with the act of rejecting a previous premise or argument.

3. **Inform**: This would involve providing factual information, but the statement is more of a challenge to the idea of speculative justification rather than providing new factual information.

Given the context, the statement is best seen as a **Reject** because it opposes and challenges the reasoning that murder could be justified by speculative danger to the family. There is no clear politeness or meta-act involved, as the statement is a straightforward rejection of an idea.",221,93187
Elaborate,,,"The target utterance ""All that might do best case scenario is reduce the sentence."" appears to be a continuation of the previous statement, which argues against the justification of murder under speculative circumstances. The user is providing a logical continuation to support the argument that even if someone murders out of speculative protection, the best outcome legally would be a reduced sentence, not an exoneration.

Several possible communicative acts could fit here:

1. **Elaborate**: The user is expanding on their previous statement about the legal consequences of murder, providing further explanation.
2. **Inform**: The user could be seen as providing factual information regarding the potential legal outcomes.
3. **Claim**: The user might be making a subjective assertion based on their understanding or opinion of legal outcomes.

The most fitting label is **Elaborate** because the user is building on their previous statement, explaining the implications of their argument against murder. It is not purely informative because it is not a verifiable fact but rather an interpretation or speculation about legal consequences. It is also not purely a claim because the context suggests an explanatory role.

No clear politeness or impoliteness is present in this utterance, and there is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. Therefore, no additional tags are needed.",222,93188
Claim,-P,,"In the target utterance, the user expresses disbelief that they are the only one not advocating for murder. The key elements to consider here are the expression of disbelief and the implication that others are advocating for murder. 

1. **Possible Communicative Acts:**
   - **Reject:** The user could be rejecting the notion that others are advocating for murder.
   - **Claim:** The user might be making a subjective assertion about their own perspective.
   - **React:** The expression of disbelief might be a reaction to the previous comment.

2. **Narrowing Down:**
   - **Reject:** This would imply the user is directly disagreeing with a specific statement made by others advocating for murder. However, the phrasing ""I can’t believe I’m the only one with a brain here"" suggests more of an assertion about their perspective than a direct disagreement with a specific argument.
   - **Claim:** The assertion about being the only one with a brain and not advocating for murder fits the definition of a subjective assertion. The user is expressing their personal stance and perception of the conversation.
   - **React:** While there is an element of disbelief, the primary function of the statement is not just to show engagement but to assert their perspective.

3. **Testing Against Context:**
   - The preceding comment discusses the potential reduction of a sentence, suggesting some conversation about the legal implications of murder. The user's comment fits as a subjective assertion about the perceived stance of others, rather than a direct disagreement or mere reaction.

Given the above analysis, the most fitting label is **Claim** because the user is making a subjective assertion about their stance in the conversation. There is also an element of condescension in the phrasing ""I’m the only one with a brain here,"" which can be considered a violation of positive politeness.

Thus, the annotation should be:
- **Act:** Claim
- **Politeness:** –P [Condescension]
- **Meta:** None

This captures both the communicative act and the impoliteness present in the statement.",223,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""Murder is a high-level crime"" is a straightforward statement that provides factual information about the nature of murder. It doesn't express an opinion, request information, or engage in any kind of subjective assertion, which rules out acts like Claim or Desire. Instead, it aligns most closely with the act of Inform, as it delivers a factual statement that is verifiable. The context, with the previous utterance expressing disbelief about advocating murder and the next utterance condemning it, supports that this statement is part of a factual argument against murder. Thus, Inform is the most suitable label for this utterance. There are no signs of politeness or impoliteness, nor is there any indication of sarcasm or reporting, so those tags are not applicable here.",224,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance is part of a sequence discussing the severity of murder, even in situations where it might seem justifiable. The user states, “and even in cases like this it is absolutely not the right thing to do and causes more damage than good.” Here, the user is making a subjective assertion about the nature of murder as an inappropriate and harmful action, regardless of context. This aligns with the communicative act of Claim, as it is the user's opinion rather than a verifiable fact.

The prior message, “Murder is a high-level crime,” presents a factual statement. The target utterance builds on this by expressing a personal viewpoint that murder is not justified even in certain contexts. The next message, “OP seems to be more mature and reasonable now,” transitions the discussion to OP's character development, implying agreement with the sentiment in the target utterance.

Given the subjective nature of the assertion in the target utterance, Claim is the most appropriate act. There is no clear expression of politeness or meta-acts, as the statement is straightforward and does not exhibit sarcasm or irony. Therefore, no additional tags are needed.",225,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""OP seems to be more mature and reasonable now,"" is providing an opinion about OP's current state compared to their past actions. The phrase ""seems to be"" indicates a subjective observation rather than a factual statement. The word ""more"" implies a comparison with OP's past behavior, suggesting improvement or change over time. This expression doesn't provide verifiable information but rather an assessment of OP's character development. 

I will consider the following communicative acts:
1. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion that is unverifiable. The use of ""seems"" supports this as it indicates an opinion rather than an objective fact.
2. **React**: This act would involve showing engagement or an emotional response. However, the utterance is more evaluative than emotional.

After evaluating these options, ""Claim"" is the most fitting label because the statement is expressing a subjective judgment about OP's maturity and reasonableness, which cannot be objectively verified.

There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. The statement is neutral in tone, focusing on an observation of change rather than judgment.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Claim"".",226,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance expresses a clear stance against murder, making it a strong expression of personal belief or opinion. Given the context, the user is reacting to the story shared by the original poster (OP) about having committed a murder. The user states, ""I will never condone the murder of people,"" which is a subjective assertion of their moral stance. This aligns with the ""Claim"" communicative act, as it is a personal belief that is not verifiable in principle but rather a matter of personal ethics. The preceding and following messages don't indicate that the user is directly responding to someone else's argument or viewpoint, but instead expressing their own. Therefore, the most fitting label for this utterance is ""Claim.""

There is no indication of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance, as it is a straightforward expression of personal belief without any additional social or emotional elements. There are also no meta-acts present, as the statement is not sarcastic, ironic, or reported speech. Thus, the annotation will focus solely on the communicative act.",227,93188
React,-P,,"The target utterance is an edited comment, which often suggests a clarification or reaction to unexpected feedback from others. The user expresses surprise and disbelief with ""holy shit, you guys are unbelievable."" This indicates a reaction to the responses they received, likely from the same context where they mentioned not condoning murder.

Possible communicative acts:
1. **React**: The user is showing an emotional response to the comments they received, highlighting their surprise and disbelief.
2. **Reject**: It's possible to interpret this as a rejection of the community's stance or behavior, but the language here is more about the user's surprise rather than directly countering someone else's point.

The prior message indicates the user's stance against murder, and the next message shows that they are being downvoted for this stance. The target utterance is part of their response to the community's unexpected reaction. This aligns more with a **React** act, as it focuses on their emotional response rather than a direct disagreement with another statement.

Politeness considerations:
The use of ""holy shit"" and ""unbelievable"" conveys negative surprise and a hint of frustration. This can be seen as a violation of positive politeness, as it indirectly criticizes the audience's behavior or reactions.

Thus, the most fitting label is **React** with a politeness marker indicating a violation of positive politeness.",228,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""I’m being downvoted for not supporting murder"" expresses a subjective opinion about receiving negative feedback (downvotes) due to their stance on a topic (not supporting murder). This statement is unverifiable in principle because it reflects the speaker's perception and interpretation of the social dynamics in the thread. The phrase does not directly solicit information or provide verifiable facts, aligning it with the ""Claim"" act. The tone suggests disapproval of the situation, but does not include direct impoliteness such as insults or threats. Therefore, there is no clear (non-)politeness act present. The utterance is a straightforward claim about the user's experience and perception of being downvoted.",229,93187
React,,,"In the context provided, the user expresses fear and concern about the attitudes of other users, implying that their support for the original poster's actions is alarming. The key phrase here is ""you’re all potential murderers,"" which is a strong statement suggesting that those who support the original poster could themselves be capable of similar violent acts. 

1. **Claim**: This could be seen as a claim since it is a subjective assertion about the nature of the other users based on their expressed opinions. However, it also functions as a reaction to the previous discussion.

2. **React**: It can also be considered as a reaction, as the user is responding to the perceived support for murder with an emotional response of fear.

3. **Reject**: The statement could also be seen as a rejection of the views of others who support the OP, as it implicitly criticizes their stance by labeling it as potentially murderous.

The strongest fit is **React** because the primary function of the utterance is to express the user's emotional response to the discussion, rather than to make a factual or subjective claim. The focus is on the user's feeling of being scared by the others' attitudes.

There is a clear negative emotional tone, but it's not impolite in a conventional sense; rather, it's an expression of fear. There are no politeness or meta elements that need to be tagged here.",230,93187
Reject,-P,,"The target utterance ""Oh, how did I forget the restraining orders?"" appears to be sarcastic or rhetorical in nature. The user is not genuinely asking how they forgot about restraining orders but is likely responding to the previous comment about potential murderers with an ironic remark. This suggests a non-bona fide context, where the user is mocking or critiquing the idea that restraining orders are a comprehensive solution to the problem of violence or potential murder. Given this, the most fitting communicative act is ""Reject,"" as the user is indirectly disputing the implication or effectiveness of relying solely on restraining orders. This sarcasm is an instance of non-bona fide communication. 

Thus, the annotation should capture the rejection expressed through sarcasm. The politeness aspect is not overtly impolite, but it does involve a layer of sarcasm, which aligns with –P [non-bona fide].",231,93187
Desire,,,"The target utterance by jesusgrandpa expresses a wish for the existence of laws that would prevent assault and abuse, which would negate the need for restraining orders. The key phrase ""I wish"" indicates a Desire act, as it communicates a hope or want for a particular situation or state of affairs. The context of discussing restraining orders and the subsequent realization that such laws already exist supports the interpretation that this is an expression of desire rather than a factual statement. The utterance does not seem to contain sarcasm or any form of impoliteness or politeness, so no additional tags for politeness or meta-acts are necessary.",232,93187
Repair,,,"The target utterance ""I forgot, there is."" is a response to the previous comment about wishing there were laws against assaulting and abusing significant others and children. The user ""jesusgrandpa"" is pointing out that such laws already exist. This utterance seems to be correcting or pointing out the oversight in the previous comment.

Possible communicative acts include:
1. **Inform**: Providing factual information that such laws exist. However, the phrase ""I forgot"" suggests a different nuance.
2. **Repair**: Correcting a misconception or oversight in the previous utterance by pointing out that the desired laws already exist.
3. **Reject**: Disagreeing with the implication in the previous comment that such laws don't exist.

The most fitting label is **Repair** because the user is correcting the oversight that the previous comment seemed to imply there are no such laws, thereby clarifying the misunderstanding. The phrase ""I forgot"" is used here rhetorically to highlight the oversight.

The politeness or impoliteness is not explicitly clear in this context, as the statement is straightforward and factual without any apparent sarcasm or rudeness. Thus, no politeness or meta act tag is applied.",233,93187
Reject,-P,,"In this target utterance, the user jesusgrandpa is responding to a previous statement that likely suggested the mother's boyfriend might fear consequences for his actions, such as trespassing. The user dismisses this notion by sarcastically questioning the ""fantasy land"" where the boyfriend would be concerned about such a minor offense given his history of more severe crimes. The tone here is dismissive and implies disbelief in the previous user's logic.

Two possible communicative acts are:
1. **Reject**: The user is essentially rejecting the idea that the boyfriend would care about trespassing.
2. **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about the boyfriend's character and his lack of fear regarding crimes.

The dismissive tone and the use of ""fantasy land"" suggest a strong rejection of the previous argument. Additionally, there is an element of sarcasm, indicated by the disbelief in the premise that the boyfriend would fear trespassing when he has committed more serious offenses.

Therefore, the most fitting label is **Reject** with an additional note of impoliteness due to the sarcastic tone. The sarcasm can be classified as a violation of positive politeness, as it mocks the previous user's statement.

The utterance does not report another's words, nor is it a non-bona fide act beyond the sarcasm already considered, so no additional meta tags are needed beyond the politeness annotation.",234,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance, ""Whatever crimes he’s committed is still not a justification for OP’s murder of this bf,"" is a response to the previous message that discusses the boyfriend's disregard for the law. The user is making a counterpoint to the implied justification of the murder based on the boyfriend's prior criminal behavior.

1. **Reject**: The user is disputing the idea that the boyfriend's previous crimes justify the murder, which is a form of disagreement. This fits the pattern of a Reject act, as it directly challenges a notion that might be implied from the previous discourse.

2. **Claim**: It could be seen as a Claim because the user is asserting a moral stance on the justification of actions, but it is more strongly aligned with Reject because it is directly opposing an implied argument rather than just stating a belief.

3. **Behave**: While the user is alluding to legal and moral norms, the primary function here is to dispute the justification of the murder, rather than to call attention to norms in a general sense.

Given the context, the Reject act is the most fitting because the utterance is primarily aimed at disputing a justification for the murder based on the boyfriend's past actions. There is no clear politeness or meta-act indicated. The user's tone is neutral and focused on making a counterargument rather than engaging in politeness or impoliteness. 

Therefore, the most accurate label for the target utterance is ""Reject.""",235,93190
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Vigilante justice is illegal and also a really backwards way of thinking"" serves as a commentary on the concept of vigilante justice. The user is making an assertion about the nature of vigilante justice, stating it is both illegal and a backwards way of thinking. This statement appears to be presented as a factual claim about the legal status of vigilante justice and an opinion about its moral or philosophical implications. 

Considering the communicative-act taxonomy:
1. **Inform**: This act involves providing verifiable factual information. The statement that ""vigilante justice is illegal"" fits this category because it is a factual claim that can be verified.
2. **Claim**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. The part of the statement that says vigilante justice is ""a really backwards way of thinking"" is more of a subjective opinion, thus fitting the definition of a claim.

The user's statement combines both an informative element and an opinionated claim. However, the primary focus seems to be on expressing a perspective on vigilante justice, emphasizing its illegality and impracticality. Given the context of discussing the moral and legal implications of OP's actions, the act of making a subjective assertion about vigilante justice being ""a really backwards way of thinking"" is more prominent.

Therefore, the appropriate label for this utterance is **Claim**. There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts in the statement, so those categories are left empty.",236,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""OP was a child of 14."" appears to provide factual information about OP's age at the time of the incident. The prior message criticizes the concept of vigilante justice, emphasizing its illegality and backwardness. The target utterance seems to counter this by highlighting that OP was only 14 years old, suggesting a context of immaturity or lack of full understanding. The next message, ""What did he know?"" further supports this by questioning OP's awareness or comprehension at that age.

Considering the options:
1. **Inform**: This label fits as the utterance presents a verifiable fact about OP's age.
2. **Claim**: This is less likely since the statement is more factual than subjective.

Given the context, the intention of the speaker seems to be to provide factual information about OP's age to imply a lack of maturity rather than to assert a subjective opinion. Therefore, ""Inform"" is the most appropriate label.

The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness, and there are no meta-acts like sarcasm or reported speech involved. Therefore, those fields will remain empty.",237,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""What did he know?"" is an interrogative form, suggesting it is seeking information, which would typically align with the ""Inquire"" act. However, in this context, the user is likely making a rhetorical statement rather than genuinely seeking an answer. The context provided by the previous and next utterances indicates that the user is reflecting on the situation of the Original Poster (OP) being just 14 years old, implying that the OP lacked the knowledge or maturity to fully understand the situation. This rhetorical use of a question to make a point aligns more closely with the ""Claim"" act, where the user is asserting that the OP's young age limited their understanding. There is no evidence of politeness or impoliteness in this rhetorical question, nor is there any sarcasm or irony, so no additional tags are necessary. Therefore, the best-fitting label for this utterance is ""Claim.""",238,93187
Accept,,,"To determine the communicative act for the target utterance, we should consider the context provided by the surrounding messages. The previous message, ""What did he know?"" seems to be questioning the awareness or understanding of someone, likely the mother's boyfriend or the mother herself. The target utterance, ""Should his mother have gotten them out? Yes."" is responding to an implied question or criticism regarding the mother's actions, specifically whether she should have removed her children from the abusive situation.

The target utterance is structured as a rhetorical question followed by an affirmative answer. This suggests an implicit agreement with the critique that the mother should have acted differently. The use of ""Yes"" indicates concurrence with the implied expectation or norm that a mother should protect her children from harm.

The next message continues this pattern by stating, ""Should she never have subjected OP and his sister to this? Yes."" This further supports the interpretation that the target utterance is agreeing with a critique of the mother's actions.

Considering these factors, the most appropriate communicative act label for the target utterance is ""Accept"" because it expresses agreement with a normative expectation about the mother's responsibilities.

There are no clear indications of politeness or impoliteness, as the utterance is neutral in tone. Additionally, there is no use of non-bona fide language or reporting, so no additional tags are needed.",239,93187
Behave,,,"The target utterance ""Should she never have subjected OP and his sister to this? Yes."" is part of a sequence of rhetorical questions followed by affirmative answers. The preceding and following utterances also follow this pattern, with each question implying a critique of the situation described by the original poster (OP).

1. **Consider ""Claim""**: This act involves making a subjective assertion. However, the structure of the utterance as a rhetorical question followed by an affirmation doesn't fit a straightforward subjective assertion. Instead, it implies a judgment about what should have happened, which is more evaluative than a typical claim.

2. **Consider ""Reject""**: This act involves disagreement or challenge. Although the rhetorical question implies disapproval of the mother's actions, it is not directly disagreeing with another statement but rather affirming a negative judgment of the situation.

3. **Consider ""Behave""**: This act involves calling attention to social norms or expectations. The rhetorical question implies that the mother should have acted according to a social norm to protect her children, which aligns with the ""Behave"" act. The user is highlighting an expectation that the mother should not have subjected her children to an abusive environment.

Given the rhetorical nature of the question and the affirmation that follows, ""Behave"" seems the most fitting label as it points to an expectation of how a parent should behave, reinforcing societal norms about protecting children.

Politeness is not overtly present, as the structure is more about asserting expectations rather than direct interaction with the addressee. There is no sarcasm or additional layers of meaning, so no meta-act is applicable.

Therefore, the most appropriate label for the utterance is ""Behave.""",240,93187
Claim,,,"In this context, the target utterance is part of a series of rhetorical questions that are being answered affirmatively. The user, woolfchick75, is making assertions about what should not have happened, emphasizing the wrongness of the boyfriend's abuse. This utterance seems to be part of a broader commentary on the situation described in the thread starter message, where the user's rhetorical questions highlight the moral judgments about the actions of the mother and the boyfriend.

The most fitting communicative act here is ""Claim."" Even though these statements are phrased as questions, they are essentially assertions made by the user to express a subjective moral stance on the situation. The answers ""Yes"" to both rhetorical questions serve as affirmations of these assertions.

The utterance doesn't fit ""Inform"" because it doesn't provide verifiable factual information—it's a subjective judgment. It also doesn't fit ""Reject"" or ""Accept"" because there's no direct agreement or disagreement with another user's point, but rather an assertion of the user's own perspective.

There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness, and the use of rhetorical questions suggests a ""non-bona fide"" element, but it is not sarcasm or irony. Therefore, no additional politeness or meta tags are necessary beyond noting the act as a claim.",241,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance is discussing the situation that the original poster (OP) was in, and it provides a perspective on OP's actions. The phrase ""Let’s just say it was a terrible situation"" suggests an attempt to summarize or generalize the context, which can be seen as a form of elaboration on the situation. The latter part of the sentence, ""OP did the only thing he knew at the time to protect his sister,"" offers an explanation for OP's actions, indicating a subjective assertion that OP's response was the only perceived option at that moment.

This utterance does not explicitly provide new factual information nor does it seek to cause action or seek information from others, so acts like Inform, Direct, or Inquire are not suitable. The act of Claim involves making a subjective assertion, which fits the interpretation that the utterance reflects the speaker's perspective on OP's decision, rather than providing an objective fact.

Given the context, the most fitting communicative act label is Claim, as the utterance reflects a subjective viewpoint on OP's actions in the situation. There are no clear indications of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm, so those tags are not applicable here.",242,93188
Reject,,,"The target utterance is ""Still doesn’t excuse murder."" Let's consider the possible communicative acts:

1. **Reject**: The user is disagreeing with the previous statement that suggests the original poster (OP) acted out of protection for his sister. By stating ""Still doesn’t excuse murder,"" the user is challenging the notion that the action taken by OP was justified, thus rejecting the attempt to rationalize the murder.

2. **Behave**: This might involve calling attention to social norms against murder, but the utterance is more of a disagreement than an emphasis on norms.

3. **React**: This could be seen as a negative reaction to the previous comment, but the specific wording ""doesn't excuse"" indicates a stronger form of disagreement than mere reaction.

Given the context, the user explicitly challenges the justification of the murder. The phrase ""Still doesn’t excuse murder"" is a direct dispute of the previous user's attempt to justify the situation. Therefore, the most fitting label is **Reject**.

There is no clear politeness or impoliteness marker. The statement is straightforward without any embellishments that would indicate sarcasm or hostility. Thus, no politeness or meta-act label applies here.",243,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance expresses disbelief and criticism of others in the thread for defending murder. The user is not merely stating a fact but is making a subjective assertion about their feelings towards the behavior of others in the discussion. It reflects their personal opinion and judgment about the situation. The phrase ""I can't believe"" indicates an emotional response and a subjective viewpoint rather than an attempt to provide factual information or request information.

Considering the possible communicative acts:
- **Claim**: This fits well since the utterance is a subjective assertion of disbelief and criticism.
- **Reject**: This could be considered, as the user is indirectly disagreeing with those defending murder, but it leans more towards expressing a personal viewpoint rather than directly disputing another statement.
- **React**: The emotional tone of disbelief might suggest a reaction, but the main purpose is to assert a viewpoint rather than simply engage or show listenership.

The Claim act is the most fitting because the primary function is to express disbelief and critique the behavior of others in the thread, which is a subjective assertion. There is a hint of a negative tone in the disbelief, but no explicit impoliteness is conveyed.

There is no clear politeness or impoliteness marker, and the utterance is bona fide without sarcasm or irony.",244,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance expresses concern about the people on the thread, suggesting that by defending murder, they are revealing themselves as having homicidal tendencies. This is a subjective assertion about the character or intentions of others, which aligns with the communicative act of ""Claim"" since it is not verifiable in principle. The tone of the utterance is sarcastic, as it exaggerates the behavior of others to make a point, indicating a meta-act of ""[non-bona fide]"". The sarcasm also serves to criticize or mock the other commenters, which could be considered a violation of positive politeness, specifically ""–P [Insult]"" as it implies a negative judgment on their character. However, given the context and the sarcastic tone, the primary focus here is on the sarcasm itself. Therefore, the best labels are ""Claim"" for the act and ""[non-bona fide]"" for the sarcasm.",245,93187
Claim,,,"In the context of the discussion, the target utterance ""Vengeance never wins."" appears to be a general statement rather than a direct response to any specific comment. This utterance can be interpreted in a few ways. It could be a **Claim**, where the speaker is expressing a personal belief about vengeance, suggesting that it is ineffective or counterproductive. It could also be seen as a **Direct**, where the speaker is implicitly advising against seeking vengeance, although it lacks the imperative structure typical of a directive.

Considering the prior message, which expresses concern about others outing themselves as homicidal, the target utterance seems to respond by making a moral or philosophical assertion about vengeance. Given the abstract nature of the statement and its lack of direct action or advice, **Claim** fits best. The speaker is asserting their view on the concept of vengeance, which aligns with the broader discussion on the implications of violent actions.

The statement does not include any politeness or impoliteness markers, as it is a neutral expression of a belief without addressing anyone directly or containing any social pleasantries or violations. Therefore, no additional politeness or meta tags are necessary.",246,93187
Accept,+P,,"The target utterance is ""I absolutely agree and I didn't downvote you."" Let's break this down:

1. **Consider the communicative acts:**
   - **Accept**: The user expresses agreement with the previous message (""Vengeance never wins""), which aligns with the ""I absolutely agree"" part.
   - **Apologize**: The phrase ""I didn't downvote you"" could be seen as a way to clarify or reassure the previous user, but it's not a direct apology.
   - **React**: The utterance shows engagement and support, but it's more specific than a simple reaction.

2. **Narrow down the options:**
   - The primary function of this utterance is to express agreement with the prior statement, so ""Accept"" is the most fitting label.
   - The additional information about not downvoting could be seen as an attempt to be polite or reassure the previous user, but it does not change the primary act of accepting.

3. **Politeness considerations:**
   - The utterance could be considered polite, as it expresses agreement and reassurance. This aligns with positive politeness (+P).

4. **Meta considerations:**
   - There is no indication of sarcasm or reporting, so no meta tags are needed.

Given these considerations, the best label for this utterance is ""Accept"" with positive politeness.",247,93188
Claim,,,"The target utterance ""Vengeance gets us nowhere. Ever."" is a broad, general statement. This utterance can be interpreted in a few ways. Firstly, it could be a **Claim**, as it's a subjective assertion about the concept of vengeance. Claims are often subjective and not necessarily verifiable, and this fits the description since it's a personal belief or opinion on the consequences of seeking vengeance. 

Another possibility is that it could be an **Inform** act, where the user is providing a statement that they believe to be factually true based on their understanding or experience. However, the statement ""Vengeance gets us nowhere. Ever."" feels more subjective and opinion-based rather than a factual piece of information. 

Given the context of the previous and next utterances, where the user is agreeing with someone else and then refers to historical proof, it leans more towards a **Claim**. The user seems to be expressing a viewpoint or personal belief rather than stating an objective fact.

The utterance does not contain any clear markers of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reported speech. Therefore, these tags are not applicable here. 

Overall, the most fitting label for this utterance is **Claim**.",248,93187
Inform,,,"In the target utterance, ""History proves that repeatedly,"" the speaker is making a statement about historical trends and outcomes. The use of ""proves"" suggests that the speaker is asserting a fact based on historical evidence. This aligns with the communicative act of ""Inform,"" as the speaker is providing what they perceive to be verifiable information about history. The context supports this interpretation as the previous message states, ""Vengeance gets us nowhere. Ever,"" and the target utterance supports this claim by referencing historical evidence. The next message challenges the simplicity of the argument, suggesting that the history referenced might lack context, but this does not change the act of the target utterance itself. There are no clear indicators of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm in the target utterance.",249,93187
Reject,,,"The target utterance ""But you are thinking in pretty binary terms and without context."" appears to be responding to a previous message that likely made a simplified or black-and-white assertion. The use of ""But"" indicates a contrast or disagreement with the previous message, suggesting that the speaker is challenging the way the previous message was framed. The phrase ""thinking in pretty binary terms"" suggests a critique of the previous message's lack of nuance. Additionally, ""without context"" implies that the speaker believes important information is being overlooked.

Considering the possible communicative acts:
1. **Reject**: This act involves disagreeing or challenging a prior statement. The use of ""But"" and the critique of binary thinking aligns with this act.
2. **Behave**: This act involves calling attention to social norms or expectations. Although the speaker is suggesting a more nuanced way of thinking, it's more about challenging the previous statement than enforcing a norm.

Given the context, ""Reject"" is the most fitting label as the speaker is disputing the way the previous message was framed, suggesting it's too simplistic and lacking context. There is no clear evidence of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance.",250,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance provides specific information about the original poster's (OP's) age, neurological development, and living conditions at the time of the incident. These details are factual and verifiable, as they describe a particular situation and characteristics of the OP at the time of the event being discussed. The utterance does not express a subjective opinion or desire, nor does it seek information or direct any action. It is purely informational in nature. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform."" There are no indications of politeness or meta-acts like sarcasm or reporting in this context.",251,93190
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""He murdered."" is a concise statement that provides a factual piece of information regarding the actions of the original poster (OP). It aligns with the criteria for an ""Inform"" act, as it is a verifiable statement about the past event. The previous message offers context by highlighting the OP's age and difficult circumstances, while the next message discusses the need for the OP to be held accountable, considering the extenuating circumstances. These surrounding messages do not alter the factual nature of the target utterance. There is no indication of politeness or meta-acts such as sarcasm or reporting within the target utterance. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this utterance is ""Inform.""",252,93187
Claim,,,"The target utterance, ""He absolutely deserved to be made responsible for this with thought and judgment given to the extenuating circumstances, which are often included in the law,"" follows the statement ""He murdered"" and precedes ""He served time."" The user is expressing a viewpoint regarding the necessity of holding someone accountable for their actions while considering legal principles like extenuating circumstances.

1. **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about what should happen in terms of responsibility and legal judgment. This reflects the user's belief system or opinion, which aligns with the definition of a claim.

2. **Direct**: Another possibility could be that the user is suggesting a course of action (i.e., making someone responsible). However, the use of past tense (""deserved"") indicates this is more an expression of belief about past events rather than a directive for future action.

3. **Behave**: This label could apply if the utterance were calling attention to social norms or expectations, but the focus here is on legal responsibility rather than social behavior.

Given the context and the phrasing used, ""Claim"" is the most fitting label as the utterance expresses an opinion about responsibility and legal processes. There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed, nor is there a meta-act like reporting or non-bona fide communication. Therefore, the annotation will focus solely on the act of claiming.",253,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""He served time."" provides a factual statement about the subject's legal consequences. It states that the person in question was incarcerated, which is a piece of verifiable information. The immediate context with the previous and next utterances also supports this interpretation, as both discuss aspects related to punishment and legal responsibility. This leads me to consider the primary communicative act as ""Inform"" because it provides factual information about the situation. There is no expression of emotion, desire, or subjective assertion, which excludes acts like ""Claim"" or ""React."" Since the utterance is straightforward and factual, there are no politeness or meta-act indicators present. Therefore, ""Inform"" is the most appropriate label here.",254,93187
Inform,,,"The target utterance ""He was punished."" follows ""He served time."" and is followed by ""And he got help."" Each of these statements provides factual information about the consequences and actions taken after the initial event described by the original poster.

1. **Possible Acts**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance states a factual consequence (""He was punished"") that follows logically from serving time, suggesting a factual recount of events.
   - **Claim**: If the statement were subjective or unverifiable, it might be considered a claim. However, ""He was punished"" is a factual statement about the legal consequences faced by the individual.

2. **Contextual Clues**:
   - The use of ""He was punished"" is a factual assertion that complements the previous statement (""He served time""), implying that the punishment was part of the legal process.
   - The subsequent statement ""And he got help"" suggests a sequence of factual events rather than subjective claims.

3. **Politeness/Meta Consideration**:
   - There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. It is a straightforward factual statement.
   - No meta-acts like reported speech or non-bona fide elements are present.

Based on the context and the nature of the utterance, the most fitting label is **Inform**. It provides factual information about the individual facing punishment for their actions.",255,93187
Inform,,,"In analyzing the target utterance ""And he got help,"" I first consider the immediate context. The previous utterance states ""He was punished,"" which suggests a factual recounting of events regarding the consequences faced by the individual in question. The target utterance follows this with additional information about the person receiving help, which aligns with providing factual information. 

The primary consideration is whether this utterance is an Inform or a Claim. An Inform act involves providing verifiable information, while a Claim involves subjective assertions or opinions. In this context, ""he got help"" is presented as a factual statement about what happened to the individual, similar to the previous statement about being punished. There is no indication of subjectivity or personal opinion, making it more likely to be an Inform.

Additionally, there are no markers of politeness or impoliteness, and there's no non-bona fide language such as sarcasm. The utterance appears straightforward and factual.

Therefore, the most appropriate communicative act for the target utterance is Inform, with no additional politeness or meta-acts.",256,93188
